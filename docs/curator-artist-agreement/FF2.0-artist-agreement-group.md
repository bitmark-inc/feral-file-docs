# Artist Agreement Group

**{Artist Name}:**

Curator {Curator Name} has invited you to a group exhibition to be opened on Feral File in {Date}. 

Below, I am providing you with the terms of our agreement for your work to be exhibited and sold on [Feral File](https://feralfile.com). Please let me know if you have any questions.

**Feral File Overview**
- Exhibitions start with a curator and their vision. Curators invite artists to collaborate together as a collective.
- Each artist creates one or more series — a collection of related artworks. Each “thing” in a series is a unique artwork. The exhibition presents a new series from each artist.
- Artworks are “born-digital” and represent an ambitious creative effort by the artist. 
- All artists create an equal number of series for the exhibition, each of the same number.
    - Series can be small to thousands of artworks.
    - Series can be created from any medium. Series can be a single data type selected from: generative (code), video, image, 3d models, language, etc. 
- An “exhibition set” is one artwork from each artist’s series.
- Artists exhibit and collect the exhibition together. Each artist, each curator, and Feral File collects one exhibition set. 
- Artworks are sold to the public exclusively together via exhibition sets.

**The idea of Feral File is that we will succeed together. _[–GRAPH](https://feralfile.com/exhibitions/graph-eg6)_ is a strong example of a model Feral File group exhibition.**

**In general, artwork installation must be completed <u>at least six weeks in advance of the opening<u>. Specific due dates for all tasks are shared within the Feral File exhibition installation interface.**

Failure to complete tasks on time may delay the exhibition or force the exhibition to continue without your participation.

Below is a summary of your responsibilities: 

1. **Install your series through the Feral File exhibition installation interface**
    1. Work with the curator to define one or more series to be exhibited. 
    1. This work must not be available anywhere else, but it can be related to existing work.
    1. Prepare for the exhibition with your curator and other artists on Feral File’s Discord. (The Feral File team will assist with installation issues.)
1. **Promote the exhibition and your fellow exhibition artists**
    1. Join online for online openings and social events, such as live discussions through Twitter Spaces.
    1. Be available for press interviews and other content production used to promote the exhibition.
    1. Promote the exhibition across your networks: social media, press contacts, potential collectors, mail lists. (The Feral File team will work closely with you to maximize your impact and produce marketing assets for distribution.)
    1. Provide a short biography for the curator to edit. Share career highlights (press mentions, awards, notable artwork appearances/installations) with Feral File. This information will be used to promote you and the exhibition.
1. **Support the financial success of the exhibition**
    1. Through the Feral File exhibition installation interface, transfer artworks (all series artworks will be preminted in your name and then held for sale by Feral File) to the following persons free of charge, in the order listed:
        1. The curator of the exhibition;
        1. The other artists in the exhibition; and
        1. Bitmark/Feral File.
    1. Withhold from selling your exhibition set (in its entirety or through individual artworks) until exhibition sales are complete (all artworks sold out or removed from the primary market on Feral File).

**For these responsibilities, we agree to the following compensation:**
1. **Primary Sale**
    1. You receive {artist primary sale royalty} of the purchase price, minus any applicable transaction fees* paid to the payment processor (not Bitmark/Feral File). 
1. **Secondary Sale**
    1. You receive {artist secondary sale royalty} of the purchase price, minus transaction fees.
1. **Exhibition Set of Artworks from Artist Swaps**
    1. Each artist will produce artworks that are part of the “artist swap” for that exhibition. As noted above, you will receive an exhibition set of one artwork from each series in the exhibition, including your own.
    1. Future sales or other dispositions of such artworks are subject to the [Art Sale Agreement](https://feralfile.com/docs/art-sale-agreement), under which you will pay the artist {artist secondary sale royalty} of the selling price, pay Feral File {Feral File secondary sale royalty} of the selling price, and will retain {collector secondary sale royalty} of the selling price, minus transaction fees. Payments from secondary markets are received by Feral File and then distributed to the artist.

** Transaction fees may differ based on the collector’s payment method (cryptocurrency, credit card)  and the exhibition’s minting fees, but typically average 3%. You can use our worksheet to understand how the payment structure breaks down (you will need to make a copy to edit the figures): [Feral File Exhibition Financials - Artist + Curator - 2023](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gpOSaji6kQ3jLjtzQU7ixlATfXmNWq5Cv-vZ_fRx_Qw/edit#gid=1326931850) 

**You will receive sale proceeds directed to your preferred web3 wallets designated using the Feral File exhibition interface.**

If the exhibition does not proceed due to events beyond the reasonable control of Bitmark/Feral File, this Agreement will be deemed canceled, without liability or obligation for you or Bitmark/Feral File. Any rights in your artworks granted to Bitmark, the curator, or other artists will not apply, and  Bitmark  will securely destroy any copies of the artworks in its possession or control.

You can review the full terms and conditions of your rights in the current version of the [Art Sale Agreement](https://feralfile.com/docs/art-sale-agreement) and [Terms for Artists and Collectors](https://feralfile.com/docs/terms-of-artist-collector).
