# Artist agreement

**{Artist Name}:**

I am providing you with the terms of our agreement for your work to be exhibited and sold on [Feral File](https://feralfile.com) with curator {NAME} in {MONTH/YEAR} through a {SOLO/GROUP} exhibition. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Each Feral File exhibition starts with a curator, but the exhibitions are about the artists and their editions. Expanded information to get your artwork ready and how editions are structured can be found through the [Artist Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1isKNtgd3lXWatxXBkrR9VV6synPUs0PQruL2ACsTPqw/edit?usp=sharing).

**Below is a summary of your responsibilities. Due dates for all tasks will be shared at least two months in advance. Failure to complete tasks on time may delay the exhibition or force the exhibition to continue without your participation.**



1. Work with the curator to define one or more artworks to edition for Feral File. There may be an online studio visit to meet and discuss the exhibition and your practice. 
2. Provide the curator with a short biography for them to edit.
3. Work collectively with the curator and other artists (if applicable) to determine the quantity (1 of N) and price for the editions for the exhibition. Each edition in the exhibition will have the same price and edition number.
4. Prepare your work to be installed. This work must not be available anywhere else, but it can be a part of a series and/or related to existing work. Feral File editions shouldn’t be the equivalent of a major artwork, they are more like a lithograph made by a painter, etc. They are all web-based works and shouldn’t be thought of as a traditional gallery installation. The browser is the gallery here. 
5. Follow the file format requirements outlined below in the [Artist Installation Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YBphMQGi1_mel7nNwafjo8rNjcUCxxMrZy-ViEZVWxc/edit?usp=sharing) document.
6. Finish installing your artwork on Feral File at least 30 days prior to the exhibition. You’ll be able to preview the exhibition and update the file until it meets your expectations. 
7. For non-1:1 artworks, transfer the first editions (all editions will be minted in your name and then held for sale by Feral File.) of the artwork, to the following persons free of charge, in the order listed:
    1. The curator of the exhibition;
    2. (Group exhibitions only) The other artists in the exhibition, order randomly assigned as Artist Editions - AE); and
    3. Bitmark/Feral File, for Feral File’s archives as Publisher’s Proof - PP.
8. Withhold from selling your own “Artist Edition” or any of the “Artist Editions” transferred to you by the other artists in the exhibition until all exhibition auctions (if applicable) are complete.
9. Join online for online openings and social events:
    4. Prepare for the exhibition (with other artists if applicable) and provide feedback to Feral File on Discord.
    5. Attend public opening via audio or video chat. Platform is determined by the curator in consultation with the artist(s).
10. Promote the exhibition across your networks: social media, press contacts, potential collectors, mail lists.

For these responsibilities, we agree to the following compensation:



* Primary Sale
    * Artist in Group Exhibition: You receive 66.67% (⅔) of the purchase price, minus transaction fees paid to the payment processor (not Bitmark/Feral File). Unsold editions from auctions will be offered for sale at the reserve price.
    * Artist in Solo Exhibition:  You receive 83.33% (5⁄6) of the purchase price, minus transaction fees paid to the payment processor (not Bitmark/Feral File). Unsold editions from auctions will be offered for sale at the reserve price.
    * Note: transaction fees may differ based on the collector’s payment method (cryptocurrency, credit card) and the exhibition’s minting fees, but typically average 3%.
* Secondary Sale: You receive 10% of the purchase price, minus transaction fees.
* Artist Swap in Group Exhibitions:
    * In group exhibitions, each artist will produce an artwork that is part of the “artist swap” for that exhibition. Each artwork in the swap has the same edition number and price and is sold the same way; artist editions (AE) of each artwork are  produced and swapped with every other artist. This does not preclude artists from selling other works in the exhibition outside the artist swap.
    * Future sales or other dispositions of such editions are subject to the [Art Sale Agreement](https://feralfile.com/docs/art-sale-agreement), under which you will pay the artist 10% of the selling price, pay Feral File 5% of the selling price, and will retain 85% of the selling price, minus transaction fees. Payments from secondary markets are received by Feral File and then distributed to the artist.

Transaction fees may differ based on the collector’s payment method (cryptocurrency, credit card). You can use our worksheets to understand how this breaks down (please make a copy to edit the figures):

You will be able to transfer sale proceeds through a supported cryptocurrency method of your choosing within your account on the [Feral File website](https://feralfile.com).

If the exhibition does not proceed due to events beyond the reasonable control of Bitmark/Feral File, this Agreement will be deemed canceled, without liability or obligation for you or Bitmark/Feral File.

You can review the full terms and conditions of your rights in the [Art Sale Agreement](https://feralfile.com/docs/art-sale-agreement) and [Terms for Artists and Collectors](https://feralfile.com/docs/terms-of-artist-collector). You understand and agree that this agreement, together with the documents referenced in this agreement, supersedes all prior understandings regarding its subject matter.

Understood and Agreed:
