# Artist Agreement Solo

**{Artist Name}:**

Curator {Curator Name} has invited you to a solo exhibition to be opened on Feral File in {Date}. 

Below, I am providing you with the terms of our agreement for your work to be exhibited and sold on [Feral File](https://feralfile.com). Please let me know if you have any questions.

**Feral File Overview**
- Exhibitions start with a curator and their vision. Curators invite the artist to collaborate together on the exhibition.
- Solo exhibitions feature multiple artworks (such as 1/1s and series) that fit together under a theme.
    - Artworks are “born-digital” and represent an ambitious creative effort by the artist. 
    - A series is a collection of related artworks. Each “thing” in a series is a unique artwork.
    - Series can be created from any medium. Series can be a single data type selected from: generative (code), video, image, 3d models, language, etc. 
- The  artist, curator, and Feral File receive one artwork from each series that is larger than 10 artworks (or as otherwise agreed). 

**Refik Anadol’s _[Unsupervised](https://feralfile.com/exhibitions/unsupervised-sla) _is a strong example of a model Feral File solo exhibition.**

**In general, artwork installation must be completed <u>at least six weeks in advance of the opening<u>. Specific due dates for all tasks are shared within the Feral File exhibition installation interface.**

Failure to complete tasks on time may delay the exhibition or force the exhibition to continue without your participation.

Below is a summary of your responsibilities: 
1. **Install your series through the Feral File exhibition installation interface**
    1. Work with the curator to define artworks to be exhibited. 
    1. This work must not be available anywhere else, but it can be related to existing work.
    1. Prepare for the exhibition with your curator on Feral File’s Discord. (The Feral File team will assist with installation issues)
1. **Promote the exhibition**
    1. Join online for online openings and social events, such as live discussions through Twitter Spaces.
    1. Be available for press interviews and other content production used to promote the exhibition.
    1. Promote the exhibition across your networks: social media, press contacts, potential collectors, mail lists. (The Feral File team will work closely with you to maximize your impact and produce marketing assets for distribution.)
    1. Provide a short biography for the curator to edit. Share career highlights (press mentions, awards, notable artwork appearances/installations) with Feral File. This information will be used to promote you and the exhibition.
1. **Support the financial success of the exhibition**
    1. Through the Feral File exhibition installation interface, transfer artworks (all series artworks will be preminted in your name and then held for sale by Feral File)  to the following persons free of charge, in the order listed:
        1. Yourself;
        1. The curator of the exhibition; and
        1. Bitmark/Feral File.
    1. Withhold from selling any or all of the artworks allocated to you until exhibition sales are complete (all artworks sold out or removed from the primary market on Feral File).

**For these responsibilities, we agree to the following compensation:**
1. **Primary Sale**
    1. You receive 80% of the purchase price, minus any applicable transaction fees* paid to the payment processor (not Bitmark/Feral File). 
1. **Secondary Sale**
    1. You receive 7.5% of the purchase price, minus transaction fees.

** Transaction fees may differ based on the collector’s payment method (cryptocurrency, credit card) and the exhibition’s minting fees, but typically average 3%. You can use our worksheet to understand how the payment structure  breaks down (you will need to  make a copy to edit the figures): [Feral File Exhibition Financials - Artist + Curator - 2023](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gpOSaji6kQ3jLjtzQU7ixlATfXmNWq5Cv-vZ_fRx_Qw/edit#gid=1326931850) 

**You will receive sale proceeds directed to your preferred web3 wallets designated using the Feral File exhibition interface.**

If the exhibition does not proceed due to events beyond the reasonable control of Bitmark/Feral File, this Agreement will be deemed canceled, without liability or obligation for you or Bitmark/Feral File.  Any rights in your artworks granted to Bitmark or the  curator will not apply, and  Bitmark will securely destroy any copies of the artworks in its possession or control.
