# Curator Agreement

**{Curator Name}:**

I am providing you with the terms of our agreement for your work curating a new exhibition on Feral File to be launched on {Date} with the responsibilities detailed in [The Curator’s Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g6F7IiDB5D3jWExJ8-HHfJdtZB5TlB-s-Zkuz5bztTI/edit). There may be other tasks discussed and agreed upon by both parties (Bitmark/Feral File, yourself) over email.  Those tasks, once agreed, will be part of this agreement.

**For these responsibilities, we agree to pay you  the following compensation:**
- **Fixed fee of $2,000, paid in USDC.**
- **{curator primary sale royalty} share of Bitmark’s portion of Net Sales from the exhibition**, paid in the currency of the transaction (USDC is used for credit card transactions)
- **You will receive an artwork from each series of a group exhibition or from each series of a solo exhibition that is larger than 10 artworks (or as otherwise agreed).** Future sales or other dispositions of such editions are subject to the [Art Sale Agreement](https://feralfile.com/docs/art-sale-agreement) with the following fee structure: You will pay the artist {artist secondary sale royalty} of the selling price, pay Feral File {Feral File secondary sale royalty} of the selling price, and retain {collector secondary sale royalty} of the selling price, minus transaction fees.  

You can use [this worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gpOSaji6kQ3jLjtzQU7ixlATfXmNWq5Cv-vZ_fRx_Qw/edit#gid=1326931850) to understand how the payment structure other than the fixed fee breaks down (you will need to make a copy to edit the figures). Transaction fees may differ based on the collector’s payment method (cryptocurrency, credit card) and the exhibition’s minting fees, but typically average 3%.

You must withhold from selling any and all of the artworks allocated to you until exhibition sales are complete (all artworks sold out or removed from the primary market on Feral File).

**Feral File exhibitions start with a curator and their vision.**
- Artworks are “born-digital” and represent an ambitious creative effort by  the artist. 
    - All artwork will run through a web browser, web-native media.
    - Artists are encouraged to create collector file packages to include additional information, specialized collector benefits, and multiple media formats. These are uploaded to Feral File as a .ZIP that the collector can download.
- A series, a collection of related artworks, can be small to thousands of artworks.
    - Each “thing” in a series is a unique artwork. 
    - Series can be created from any medium. Series can be a single data type selected from: generative (code), video, image, 3d models, language, etc. 
- Each online exhibition incorporates community-building and social experiences with networked openings.

**Curating Group Exhibitions**
- Curators invite artists to collaborate together as a collective.
- Each artist creates one or more series — a collection of related artworks. Each “thing” in a series is a unique artwork. The exhibition presents a new series from each artist.
- All artists create an equal number of series for the exhibition, with each series having a designated number of artworks (for example, an exhibition may require  2 series –  one with 5 artworks, and one with 10)  .
- An “exhibition set” is one artwork from each artist’s series.
- Artists exhibit and collect the exhibition together. Each artist, each curator, and Feral File collects one  exhibition set. 
- Artworks are sold to the public exclusively together as exhibition sets.

**Curating Solo Exhibitions**
- Curators invite the artist to collaborate together on the exhibition.
- Solo exhibitions feature multiple artworks (such as 1/1s, series) that fit together under a theme.
- The  artist(s), curator, and Feral File receive one artwork from each series that is larger than 10 artworks (or as otherwise agreed).


The idea of Feral File is that we will succeed together. [–GRAPH](https://feralfile.com/exhibitions/graph-eg6) is a strong example of a model group Feral File exhibition. Refik Anadol’s [Unsupervised](https://feralfile.com/exhibitions/unsupervised-sla) is a strong example of a model Feral File solo exhibition.

**In general, artwork installation and all curator deliverables must be completed <u>at least six  weeks in advance of the opening<u>. Specific due dates for all tasks are shared within the Feral File exhibition installation interface.**
If you are curating this exhibition as part of your employment, you represent to Feral File: (a)  that you are receiving all artworks on behalf of your employer, and that you agree to the Art Sale Agreement on your employer’s behalf and have the authority to do so,  or (b)  that you have your employer’s permission to receive all artworks on your own behalf and that you personally agree to the Art Sale Agreement.

You will receive sale proceeds directed to your preferred web3 wallets designated using the Feral File exhibition interface, with all transactions reported automatically to your Feral File account. Your fixed fee will be paid into the same account within 30 days of the exhibition start.

If the exhibition does not proceed due to events beyond the reasonable control of Bitmark/Feral File, this Agreement will be deemed canceled, without liability or obligation for you or Bitmark/Feral File.  Any rights in your artworks granted to Bitmark or the  curator will not apply, and  Bitmark will securely destroy any copies of the artworks in its possession or control.

You understand and agree that this agreement contains all of Feral File’s obligations to you, and together with the documents referenced in this agreement, supersedes all prior understandings regarding its subject matter.  You waive any claims against Bitmark/Feral File and its management and  personnel in excess of the obligations set forth in this agreement and hold Bitmark/Feral File and its management and personnel harmless against any claims which may arise from your activities under this agreement.
