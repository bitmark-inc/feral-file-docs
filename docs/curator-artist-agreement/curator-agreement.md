# Curator Agreement

**{Curator Name}:**

I am providing you with the terms of our agreement for your work curating a new exhibition on Feral File to be launched on **{DD-MM-YYYY}** with the responsibilities detailed in [The Curator’s Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g6F7IiDB5D3jWExJ8-HHfJdtZB5TlB-s-Zkuz5bztTI/edit?usp=sharing). There may be other tasks discussed and agreed upon by both parties (Bitmark/Feral File, yourself) over email. Those tasks, once agreed, will be part of this agreement.

For these responsibilities, we agree to the following financial compensation:

- **Fixed fee of $2,000, paid in USDC or ETH.**
- **5% share of Bitmark’s portion of Net Sales from the exhibition, paid in USDC or ETH.**

**You will also receive an edition of each editioned (non-1:1) artwork in your exhibition.** Future sales or other dispositions of such editions are subject to the [Art Sale Agreement](https://feralfile.com/docs/art-sale-agreement). You will pay the artist {resale_artist_revenue} of the selling price, pay Feral File **{resale_feralfile_revenue}** of the selling price, and retain **{resale_collector_revenue}** of the selling price, minus transaction fees. Transaction fees may differ based on the collector’s payment method (cryptocurrency, credit card) and the exhibition’s minting fees, but typically average 3%.

You can use [this worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BDCeAIfsxmPHcalPhoXHGnnNEOFHJUtT6tN3qyfrlc8/edit#gid=57783252) to understand how this breaks down (please make a copy to edit the figures).

If you are curating this exhibition as part of your employment, you represent to Feral File that: (a) you are receiving each such edition on behalf of your employer, agree to the Art Sale Agreement on your employer’s behalf and have the authority to do so, or (b) you have your employer’s permission to receive such edition on your own behalf and that you personally agree to the Art Sale Agreement.

You will be able to transfer sale proceeds through a supported cryptocurrency method of your choosing within your account on the [Feral File website](https://feralfile.com), with all transactions reported automatically to your Feral File account. Your fixed fee will be paid into the same account within 30 days of the exhibition start.

If the exhibition does not proceed due to events beyond the reasonable control of Bitmark/Feral File, this Agreement will be deemed canceled, without liability or obligation for you or Bitmark/Feral File.

You understand and agree that this agreement contains all of Feral File’s obligations to you, and together with the documents referenced in this agreement, supersedes all prior understandings regarding its subject matter. You waive any claims against Bitmark/Feral File and its management and personnel in excess of the obligations set forth in this agreement and hold Bitmark/Feral File and its management and personnel harmless against any claims which may arise from your activities under this agreement. 

**If you understand and accept the responsibilities explained above and in The Curator’s Guide, please confirm acceptance of this project and the terms of this agreement by signing below.**

Sincerely,
<br>Michael Nguyễn
