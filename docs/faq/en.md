### Visiting an Exhibition

#### How can I find out about upcoming exhibitions?
We will announce all upcoming exhibitions on this website, [through our email](https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&id=534ea3fa0f) announcements, and through our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/feralfile) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/feralfile/) accounts. You can also keep up to date in the Feral File [Discord](https://discord.gg/Wm2ZvGSxqg). Add opening time to your [Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19wbmJxdnJoYmZwMmFmN2N0NHEwNWQzbnRrc0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).


#### What Does the Starting Time of an Exhibition Mean?
The starting time for each exhibition denotes when the artwork in the exhibition becomes available for viewing. Editions will be available for collecting one hour after an exhibition opens.

There’s no need to refresh your page during the first 60 minutes! You’ll see a countdown timer, and as soon as it hits zero, you’ll be able to start collecting!


### Collecting an Edition

#### How do I access my account?
You can access your account either through the website or a supported crypto wallet.

If you access via the website, you will receive an email from [support@feralfile.com](mailto:support@feralfile.com) with a link that will log you into the site. Feral File uses these “magic links” in place of username/password pairs.

Alternatively, you can sign in using any [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/)-compatible wallet, including [Autonomy](https://bitmark.com/autonomy) and [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/). Simply choose the “Sign in with WalletConnect” option on the website. External programs such as Autonomy and other WalletConnect apps will then be able to scan a QR code to continue the login process.


#### What does it mean to collect a work on Feral File?
Collecting an edition on Feral File gives you more rights than most digital purchases. When you buy a song or an eBook, for example, you are buying a limited license that grants you the right to consume the media—but often only in one specific way, or for a limited amount of time, because you don’t truly own it. Collecting a work on Feral File is different, because you gain property rights to the files you collect. All editions of artwork on Feral File are Bitmark NFTs (see below) that combine the media with a property-rights contract. Once you purchase a work, you have access to the original, high-quality files and you can download, display, and even resell, loan, or gift them or migrate to Ethereum. If you collect a software edition, you’ll have access to the source code, too. All editions collected on Feral File grant the owner a “bundle of rights,” which are detailed in the [Artist + Collector Rights](https://feralfile.com/docs/artist-collector-rights) document.


#### How are artworks priced on Feral File?
While Feral File editions are priced to be more accessible than art sold through traditional galleries and many other NFT platforms, we also aspire to price works in a way that’s fair and sustainable for both our artists and for collectors. That said, the curator and the artists for each exhibition set the edition number and price for each edition featured in a show—with all artworks in the same exhibition sharing the same starting price and number of released editions. As a general rule, artworks released as smaller editions will be priced higher per edition than those released as part of a larger edition.

Prices in Feral File are set in US Dollars and the equivalent USDC.


#### What is a Set?
A set is a collection of all the artwork in an exhibition. A set sale thus allows you to collect all the artwork in an exhibition at once; the curator decides how many editions to reserve.

Set sales are only available during the first 24 hours (usually) of an exhibition. After the first 24 hours, any editions previously reserved for sets that were not sold will become available to all collectors. If the set sales in Group Auctions do not sell out, the Group Auctions will transit into Fixed-Price sales and the set sales will extend another 24 hours. 


#### How many editions can I collect?
During an exhibition, you can collect at most one set of the available artwork (when sets are available) and one of each individual piece. This allows more collectors to purchase artwork from an exhibition and ensures that Feral File is a fair space for collectors. If you’d like to collect additional copies of an artwork, you can do so by purchasing them from previous buyers.


#### Where are the Feral File NFTs stored?
Feral File has its own storage (currently hosted on amazon S3) which is then mirrored over IPFS, a distributed file system. You can see the links in the metadata of the Ethereum or Tezos contracts for your NFTs. You can also download your editions and provide your own backup.

For more detailed information, please view:

- [Tezos Contract design](https://hackmd.io/WxdKl13DS0yrsj3ieemzYg)


#### How can I view my artwork on Feral File if I purchase the edition on another platform?
Once you have purchased a Feral File edition on another platform, create a Feral File account and connect it to your Crypto wallet.


### Payment
#### What is USDC?
USDC stands for USD Coin, a cryptocurrency stablecoin that remains equal to a US Dollar. That means that $1 USDC is always valued at $1 USD: the two are equivalent. Each USDC token also represents a real US dollar that is being held in reserve.


#### How do I increase my account balance?
You can increase your account balance through the deposit of cryptocurrencies. Feral File currently accepts Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), USD Coin (USDC), and Tezos (XTZ). Choose the Deposit function under [Account](https://feralfile.com/account), and you'll be given an address to send a transaction to. When the transaction is finalized, your account will be credited with the appropriate amount of USDC funds.


#### What are the fees for deposits or withdrawals?
For USDC deposits and withdrawals, there is only the USDC transaction fee.

For Bitcoin and Ethereum deposits and withdrawals, there is again a transaction fee for the network. In addition, our conversion partner Wyre charges a 0.75% conversion fee. Finally, the volatility of exchange rates can cause additional differences in the amount transferred. Because of these third-party fees and the exchange volatility, you will likely need to deposit more funds than the price of an edition, and you will receive less than you withdraw. We suggest depositing and withdrawing your funds in USDC to minimize conversion fees and exchange rate differences, but support Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tezos deposits and withdrawals if that is your preference.

Bitmark itself charges no fees to collectors; your account balance is an accurate measure of exactly how much money you have available for collecting.


#### Why is the account balance stored in USDC?
We chose the USDC stablecoin because it’s connected to the US dollar, which means its price doesn’t fluctuate wildly like Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. This lets you maintain an account balance without worrying about losing money. But, if you prefer, you can also withdraw from your Feral File account at any time.

Deposit your BTC, ETH or XTZ into your Feral File account by copying the address in your profile, and sending your cryptocurrency to that address. The BTC, ETH or XTZ will automatically be transferred into USDC on our backend.


#### Why do I need to collect in USDC?
This is an interim step toward supporting works minted on other blockchains, like Tezos, in the future. Feral File has always used USDC, and will be offering more direct ETH and XTZ support in the coming months. At that point, your crypto wallet can connect you to your Feral File account, and you can collect directly with the assets in your wallet.

#### Is it better to pay with cryptocurrency or credit card?
Use whichever works best for you. Collectors do not receive any advantage whether they use credit cards or cryptocurrency. Whether they can purchase artwork depends solely on how quickly they choose to do so once it becomes available for collecting. However, do note that you must use cryptocurrency when you collect artwork from other collectors in secondary sales, as discussed below.


#### Why can’t I use my credit card for artwork being resold?
We currently do not permit the use of credit cards for artwork being resold by previous buyers. This is because credit card payments can be reversed for 60 days, which would open us to fraud since we never delay payments to sellers. However, we are working on enabling this for secondary market sales by Q4-2022.


#### I am having issues buying with my credit card. What can I do?
We use Stripe's Hong Kong division to process credit card payments. As a result, your credit card company may ask you to verify transactions coming from Feral File before authorizing the purchase. You can prevent most issues by letting them know you are making a transaction in Hong Kong.


### Auctions
#### Why are some editions collected through auctions?
Auctions can offer advantages to both collectors and artists.

For collectors, you get more opportunity to collect the editions that you’re most interested in, rather than them being grabbed by the person with the best internet connection or the most skilled clicking finger.

For artists, you get the opportunity to sell your most popular pieces at market prices, rather than having to guess at their value. In addition, you have the ability to sell premium pieces for higher values.


#### What does it mean that my funds are reserved after I make a bid?
When you are bidding in an auction, the funds that you bid are unavailable for other usage until you are outbid (in which case the funds are freed up) or until you win the auction (in which case the funds are paid out).


#### What types of auctions does Feral File support?
Feral File currently supports two types of auctions. The highest-bid auction sells a single edition to the highest bidder in an open auction; and the group auction sells editions to a number of highest bidders in a sealed auction. They’re each explained in more depth below.


### Highest-bid Auctions
#### What is a highest-bid auction?
A highest-bid auction is an open-bid English auction won by the single highest bid. It’s the most similar to a traditional auction that you might see in an auction house, where people hold up their numbers as the auctioneer calls out new bid values.

In a highest-bid auction, you can make a bid greater than the current bid value for an item and then become the new winning bidder. The person with the highest winning bid at the end of the auction gets to collect the edition.


#### Is the full amount of my bid immediately pledged?
Yes. 

This is different from an eBay auction where you make semi-closed bids that are effectively “maximum bids”. In Feral File’s highest-bid auction, the sale price of the item will immediately jump to your full bid, so bid carefully.

(Of course, if you are outbid, your money is no longer reserved.)


#### How much time do I have to bid on a highest-bid auction?
A highest-bid auction lasts for a set time, usually 24 hours, and is extended to 10 more minutes if a highest bid occurs with less than 5 minutes remaining.

This prevents sniping: you’ll always have a chance to respond to someone else’s bid.


#### Why use a highest-bid auction?
Artists will usually pick a highest-bid auction because they have a single, premium edition that they want to sell.


### Group Auctions
#### What is a group auction?
A group auction is a semi-open-bid Dutch auction with multiple winners. It’s one of a few styles of Dutch auctions out there.

In a group auction, an artist simultaneously auctions several editions of the same artwork. All editions in a group auction are identical except for their edition numbers, and each bidder can place only one bid at a time to try to win an edition. Participants bid individually, and, at the end of the auction, the editions are awarded to the group of highest bidders.


#### What determines who wins an edition in a group auction?
The winners are the group of highest bidders at the end of the auction. Since each bidder can only win one edition, the number of winners equals the number of editions in the auction. For example, if there are five editions in the auction, the five highest bidders will each win an edition.

In the case of a tie in which more than one bidder places the same bid, earlier bids beat later bids. For example, if the five highest bids for a group auction of five editions are one $10 bid, one $9 bid, one $8 bid, and three $5 bids , the $10, $9, $8, and earliest two $5 bidders would  each win an edition, but the last $5 bidder would not.


#### What determines the price winners pay for an edition in a group auction?
Winners do not necessarily end up paying their bid amounts for their editions. Instead, everyone in the winning group pays the amount of the lowest winning bid, or the “floor bid.”  Thus, for most winners, the amount they actually pay is less than what they actually bid.

For example, an artist might offer three editions of an artwork in a group auction and receive bids of $1, $2, $3, $4, and $5. The $5, $4, and $3 bids are the winners, and all three winners each pay $3 for their editions.

#### What determines which edition numbers winners get in a group auction?
While the amount of a bid determines which bidders win editions, the time of the bid determines which edition number each bidder wins. Earlier winning bids will receive lower-numbered editions than later winning bids, regardless of the amount of the bids. For example, if there are 3 editions with edition numbers 1-3 up for auction, and the three highest bids and bid timestamps are:

- $7 at 12:01:59
- $10 at 12:31:02, and
- $9 at 12:52:40 

then edition numbers would be awarded as follows:

- Edition 1 -> $7 at 12:01:59
- Edition 2 -> $10 at 12:31:02, and
- Edition 3 -> $9 at 12:52:40


#### What is a semi-open-bid?
Feral File group auctions don’t allow you to see all the bids during the auction; however, we do provide three pieces of real-time information to help you bid:

- **Floor Bid.** The lowest bid that is currently in the group to win an edition. For example, if there are five editions up for auction, the floor bid is the current fifth-highest bid.

- **Median Bid.** The middle bid for the artwork: half of the bids are lower and half are higher. For example, if there are five editions up for auction, the median bid is the current third-highest bid.

- **Highest Bid.** The highest of all the bids so far and, therefore, the top end of the current group of winning bids.


#### What should I bid?
The bid hints on the group-auction page give you some information, but what they mean depends on how long is left in the auction. Generally:

- Bidding slightly higher than the **floor bid** is unlikely to win an auction because it will become a loser if just one more winning bid is made. Early in an auction, this is definitely true; late in an auction, you might get lucky.

- Bidding somewhere between the **floor bid** and the **median bid** might be a good strategy, with how high you bid depending on how much time is left in the auction and how badly you want the artwork: the more time and the more interest, the higher you should go.

- Bidding the **median bid** is pretty safe if you definitely want to get an edition of an artwork. However, an early median bid might still become a loser before the auction is over. You should also be careful if the median bid is too close to the floor bid: that might indicate that you need to bid higher.

- Bidding near or above the **highest bid** gives you the best chance of winning an edition at any point in the auction.


#### Can I withdraw my bid?
No, once you make a bid, you are committed to it and cannot withdraw it. However, you can replace a bid by increasing it at any time before the auction closes.


#### Can I increase my bid?
Yes, you can increase your bid at any time, whether you’re winning or losing. Keep an eye on the bid hints throughout the auction!


#### How does this differ from other group auctions?
There are a huge variety of group auctions. Many of them are entirely closed, awarding winners when bids are unsealed and not providing any hints along the way. Other Dutch auctions start at a high value and openly count down until someone makes a bid.

The Feral File group auctions are relatively unique because of their semi-open nature. They’re the most similar to real-estate sales, which are effectively auctions where bids are sealed, but bidders might receive “hints”, usually in the form of knowing how many people are bidding. (The hints in Feral File are somewhat stronger.)


#### How much time do I have to bid on a group auction?
Group auctions will be scheduled for a set period of time following the one-hour preview for an exhibit. After the end of their bidding period, they will be closed and the winners announced. Keep in mind that if there is a tie for the lowest winning bid, the winner is whoever bid first. This means that you should place your final bid early and resist changing it later.


#### Why use a group auction?
Artists will usually pick a group auction because they have multiple premium editions that they want to sell, such as the lowest numbered editions of an NFT, or an NFT with just a few editions available.


#### What happens to my USDC after I am outbid in an auction?
Your USDC remains in your Bitmark account. You can withdraw your USDC into BTC or ETH. If you’d like to transfer your USDC back into XTZ, request support from the Bitmark team; this will need to be done manually. The most efficient way to reach them is to email [support@feralfile.com](support@feralfile.com). Please join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Wm2ZvGSxqg) if you have questions about this.


### Displaying Artwork

#### What can I do with the art I collect on Feral File?
All of the artworks on Feral File can be viewed by anyone through the Feral File online gallery at any time, but when you collect an edition, you gain the right to host the work on your own site and to download the work and exhibit it anywhere you please. You also gain the right to give the work to someone else by transferring the rights, or to resell the work directly through the Feral File site. If you resell the work, 85% of the sale will be transferred to you, 10% of the sale will be transferred to the artist, and 5% will be transferred to Feral File. Your rights to your Feral File collection are fully outlined in the Artist + Collector Rights document.

### Ethereum Bridge
#### What is the Ethereum Bridge?
The Ethereum Bridge is a way to migrate your Feral File NFTs to the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-721s. Learn more about the technical implementation of the bridge through our [documentation](https://hackmd.io/@bitmarkinc/H12g2Lklt).


#### What is the Bitmark Blockchain?
The Bitmark Blockchain is Bitmark’s digital-assets blockchain for managing the ownership of digital properties. It is the native blockchain for Feral File.


#### What is an ERC-721?
ERC-721 is the most widely used standard for tracking and transferring non-fungible tokens (NFTs) using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. When you migrate a Feral File NFT to an ERC-721, you are also moving it from the Bitmark Blockchain to the Ethereum blockchain.


#### Why would I migrate my edition to an ERC-721?
If you’re migrating your Feral File NFT to an ERC-721, you probably already have a specific purpose in doing so. The biggest reason is to move your NFT into a larger ecosystem where there may be more buyers. However, we also know that some NFT collectors believe the higher number of validating nodes on the Ethereum network results in better security, and others feel that Ethereum NFTs are more prestigious.

There are also deficits to moving to an ERC-721. The biggest is the much higher transaction cost resulting from high gas prices. There may also be tradeoffs in security, as Ethereum wallets are bigger targets for hackers.


#### How do I migrate to Ethereum?
To migrate to Ethereum, go to Collection on the Feral File website and click the artwork you would like to migrate. You will be given an option to “Migrate to Ethereum” and be able to enter an Ethereum address at that time. Note that you will need to pay a one-time gas fee to the Ethereum network to migrate your NFT. Feral File does not profit from this transaction. If this fee seems too high, please come back later. ([Click here to see the current price of Ethereum gas](https://etherscan.io/gastracker).)


### Feral File Technology
#### What’s a Bitmark NFT?
When an artwork is installed on Feral File, a record for every edition is added to the Bitmark blockchain along with metadata that includes artwork details, the art sale agreement, and the artist and collector rights. Each edition of the artwork is a separate entry and a unique piece of property, so if an artwork is released in an edition of 20, there will be 20 unique entries in the blockchain. We call each of these editions a [Bitmark NFT](https://docs.bitmark.com/meta/bitmark-eth-comparison), where NFT is an acronym for “non-fungible token,” meaning each edition of an artwork is unique.


#### How does Feral File use the Bitmark Blockchain?
Feral File uses the Bitmark blockchain to keep track of the artwork editions and the owner of each edition. Feral File only adds information to the Bitmark blockchain when an artwork is first issued by an artist, and then when the property rights are transferred from one account to another. When a new Feral File account is created, behind the scenes, a new Bitmark account is created with it. This account ID is a unique alphanumeric sequence that’s used to keep track of all Feral File transactions through the blockchain. The public [Bitmark Registry](https://registry.bitmark.com/) is an online interface to view the historical ledger of all Bitmark transactions.


#### What is Feral File's impact on the environment?
The mission of Feral File is to build a sustainable curated ecosystem for digital art, driven by the long-term interests of our artists, curators, and collectors. Learn more about our efforts around economic, environmental, and technology sustainability on our [Sustainability page](https://feralfile.com/docs/sustainability).


### Join Feral File
#### I’m an artist. Can I sell my work on Feral File?
Feral File artists are selected for each exhibition by that show’s curator. We don’t currently have a way for artists to upload work directly to Feral File or to be considered for selection by curators. However, if you’re an artist interested in joining our community, we welcome you to join the [Feral File Discord](https://discord.gg/Wm2ZvGSxqg).

#### I’m a curator. How can I curate or join a future exhibition?
We started building Feral File in June 2020, opening the first exhibition in March 2021. Since then, we’ve increased the options for what forms Feral File exhibitions can take, and now have a modular set of pieces that can be put together by artists and curators in different ways.

We are pleased to invite you to become part of our next wave of curators with our open call for proposals. [Learn more about our submissions process here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jHSk_CmNhFTA2JeE8WUTrOiiaUruhFvUk1URS7SpyOU/edit).
