#### **2.GALLERY SERVICE**

2.1. **Use of the Gallery Service.**

(a)	Subject to Users’ compliance with the Agreement, Bitmark will provide Users with access to and use of the Gallery Services, including the creation of Gallery Accounts for Users. Bitmark may monitor the use of the Gallery Service to ensure quality, improve Bitmark products and services, and verify compliance with the Agreement. Creating a Gallery Account requires a correct email address. Please note that any information (which does not include the User’s email address) recorded in a Public Blockchain under the Gallery Account is made permanently public.

(b)	Artists must establish a Gallery Account and use the Gallery Service to record Artist’s Works in the Artist’s Gallery account as Digital Property and transfer the Digital Property to Bitmark. Bitmark will transfer the Digital Property to Collectors upon Artist’s instruction to do so. At any time prior to such transfer, an Artist may request the return to their Gallery Account of any Digital Property, and Bitmark will promptly comply. The Gallery Service provides a facility for the delivery of a copy of the Artist’s Works to the relevant Collector upon completion of a sales transaction between the Artist and Collector for such Artist’s Works, but Artists are ultimately responsible for ensuring such delivery. Artist will also provide a copy of Artist’s Works to Bitmark in a form and format suitable for display in the Gallery website, together with any information to be displayed with the Artist’s Work.

(c)	Collectors must establish a Gallery Account. Bitmark will transfer Digital Property to Collectors upon Artist’s instruction to do so.

Bitmark conducts more than one type of auction, and the type of auction for a given work will be disclosed in the Work’s listing within the Gallery Service. For more information about how Bitmark’s auctions are conducted, see our [Auction Explainer](https://feralfile.com/docs/faq#auctions).

(e)	Users expressly acknowledge and agree that Bitmark is responsible only for its own activities, and is not responsible for monitoring or enforcing legal compliance or contractual obligations with respect to other parties’ actions, including with respect to the creation or transfer of Digital Property and/or the use of any Public Blockchain.

#### **4. LICENSES AND OWNERSHIP**

4.1. **User Information License.** Artist hereby grants Bitmark a royalty-free, nonexclusive, worldwide license under all of Artist’s intellectual property rights in and to (a) the Artist’s Works publicly perform, display, and distribute on and through the Gallery website the Artist’s Work in the format provided by the Artist to Bitmark for such purpose. Users hereby grant Bitmark a royalty-free, nonexclusive, worldwide license under all of the User’s intellectual property rights in and to the User’s Digital Property and Gallery Account as necessary to operate the Gallery Services as contemplated herein, and to improve and enhance the Gallery Service and Bitmark’s other offerings. To the extent that Bitmark irreversibly de-identified information so that it is not attributable to a User or any other individual, such license shall be perpetual and irrevocable as to such de-identified information for the improvement and enhancement of the Gallery Service and Bitmark’s other offerings. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.

4.2. **Ownership; FeedbacK.** The Artist’s Works, and all intellectual property rights in or relating to any of the foregoing, is owned by Artist until transferred to a Collector; the rights in the Artist's Works after transfer to a Collector are governed by the [Art Sale Agreement](https://feralfile.com/docs/art-sale-agreement). The Gallery Service and all software, data and technologies embodied in or used to provide the Gallery Service, and all intellectual property rights in or relating to any of the foregoing, is owned by Bitmark.

Bitmark shall have a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use or incorporate any Feedback into the Gallery Service or other Bitmark offerings.


#### **5. TRANSFER AND PAYMENT**

5.1. **Payment Processing.** Bitmark uses one or more third-party payment processors (the “Payment Processors”) to enable Collectors to use credit cards and other conventional payment mechanisms to pay for transfers of Digital Property. Bitmark’s current Payment Processors are Stripe and Wyre. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the appropriate Payment Processor, in addition to this Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Payment Processors may be found at https://stripe.com/legal and [https://www.sendwyre.com/user-agreement](https://www.sendwyre.com/user-agreement), respectively; the Payment Processors' privacy policies may be found at https://stripe.com/privacy and [https://www.sendwyre.com/privacy-policy](https://www.sendwyre.com/privacy-policy), respectively. Bitmark is not responsible for errors made by the Payment Processors, or otherwise in connection with the processing of transactions. By electing to use a Payment Processor to pay for transfers of Digital Properties, Collectors agree to make payment through that Payment Processor. Please be aware that Users are responsible for the payment of any tax(es) that may apply to such transactions. For each purchase, the Users grant Bitmark the right to correct any errors or mistakes that are made regarding the purchase price of a Work, even where Bitmark has already received payment. Any amounts paid hereunder are non-refundable.

5.2. **Pricing and Commissions.** Artists set the price for their Works in the Gallery, in their sole discretion. The commission payable to Bitmark and any other involved third parties upon the sale of a copy of the Work using the Gallery Services is set forth in the term sheet containing the commercial terms agreed by the Artist and Bitmark for the use of the Gallery Services. Commissions to the Artist, Bitmark, and any other involved third parties for subsequent sales or other dispositions of a copy of the Work are set forth in both the term sheet containing the commercial terms agreed by the Artist and Bitmark for the use of the Gallery Services and the collector rights disclosure presented to the Collector before purchase of the Work, payable as set forth in the agreement between the Artist and Collector in the [Art Sale Agreement](https://feralfile.com/docs/art-sale-agreement), in each case less any Payment Processor or other transaction fees. Bitmark reserves the right to change its commission schedule and to institute new charges at any time, upon notice to Users, which may be sent by email or posted within the Gallery Service. Use of the Gallery Service following such notification constitutes acceptance of any new or increased charges. Upon receipt of payment from a Collector, Bitmark will promptly pay over to the Artist the price of the Work, less the commission and a percentage of the Payment Processor fee or other transaction fees, equal to the percentage of the price paid to the Artist. For example, if the price is $1,000 the commission is 33.33% and the Payment Processor fee is 3%, the amount paid to the Artist is calculated as follows: ($1000 - $30 [3% of 1000]) x 66.66% = $646.60. All amounts due to each party hereunder exclude transactional taxes.

5.3. **User Responsibility.** In order for payments to be processed and transactions completed, Users must provide, update and maintain current, complete and accurate information (such as billing or payment address, bank account information, credit card number, or credit card expiration date), and must promptly notify Bitmark if a User’s form of making or receiving payment is canceled or if the User becomes aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of a credit or debit card, banking information, or personal information. Bitmark does not record or make payment information public in the Public Blockchain used for transactions through Bitmark.

5.4. **Transfer.** Upon receiving payment from Collector for a Work and Artist’s instruction to do so, Bitmark will effect a transfer of the relevant Digital Property to the Collector’s Gallery Account. If the associated Artist’s Work is made available to Bitmark by the Artist for transfer to a Collector, Bitmark will use reasonable efforts to transfer a copy of the Artist’s Work to the Collector. If Collector does not receive a copy of the relevant Artist’s Work from Bitmark, Collector must look solely to Artist to acquire a copy of the relevant Artist’s Work. Users agree that (i) each transfer of Digital Property made using the Gallery Service is a transaction between the Artist and the Collector, and not a transaction with Bitmark; and (ii) Bitmark is not a party to such transaction. In order to facilitate the transfer of Artist’s Works, Bitmark may share Artist and Collector contact information, including the emails of each party. Bitmark is not responsible for what either party does with this information once transmitted by Bitmark.
