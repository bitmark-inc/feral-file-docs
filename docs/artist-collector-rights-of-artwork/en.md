## Artist + Collector Rights {{art_title}}

### 1. Artist Rights

When you sell your artwork as a digital edition on Feral File, the following rights are guaranteed to you by legal contract and by the Feral File smart contract:

**You own the copyright and image rights.** This means collectors can’t copy, reproduce, or make derivatives of your work—but you still can.

**You earn a percentage of all secondary sales.** If a collector buys your work and then sells it for a profit, you’re entitled to a percentage of the sale price as stated in the term sheet containing the commercial terms for the exhibition and sale of the work on Feral File, less any transaction fees. 

**You will always be credited.** Anytime your work is displayed or shared, it must be properly attributed to you.

**Your work is protected.** Collectors can’t modify, distort, or otherwise misrepresent your work when they display it.

**You’ll know when your work changes hands.** Information about your work’s provenance and subsequent sales will be recorded on a public blockchain.

**You grant collectors certain rights to use, display, and resell your work.** Learn what collectors can do with your work in the [Art Sale Agreement](https://feralfile.com/docs/art-sale-agreement).

**You’ll retain these rights forever.** No matter where the future takes us, your rights as the artist are protected in perpetuity.
