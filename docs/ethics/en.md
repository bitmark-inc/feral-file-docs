EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION IN FERAL FILE SALES

No set of guidelines can account for every scenario. From principles, Bitmark employees may not use their knowledge or private access to guide their or othersâ€™ purchasing decisions on Feral File.

In application of these principles, Bitmark employees are prohibited from participating in any sale in which Feral File has an information advantage over the public. This includes both direct and indirect participation such as by funding a third party. For example, in highest bidder auctions, Feral File can view collector deposits and use that information to understand upcoming bids - employees cannot participate in these auctions. With fixed price sales, however, Feral File has no special access to purchase before others - employees may participate in purchasing.
