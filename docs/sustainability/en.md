FERAL FILE ON SUSTAINABILITY

The mission of Feral File is to build a sustainable curated ecosystem for digital art, driven by the long-term interests of our artists, curators, and collectors. We focus on sustainability in the following areas:

1. **Economic** — by creating sustainable relationships between artists and collectors, through evolution of the classic 1971 legal agreement “[The Artist’s Reserved Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Artist%27s_Reserved_Rights_Transfer_and_Sale_Agreement).”

2. **Technological** — by supporting open source and growing accessibility to WEB3. 

3. **Environmental** — by minting on Tezos and Ethereum, energy efficient blockchains.

Read more below to understand how we approach these issues and our commitment to sustainability. We welcome feedback from our community and will continually reassess how to improve in each area.

### Economic Sustainability

The fundamental purpose of Feral File is to reclaim digital rights for artists, who have traditionally been excluded from the financial upside when their work was resold on the secondary market; and to recognize rights for digital art collectors, who have traditionally been given very limited (or ambiguous) authority over their purchases. This creates economic sustainability through mutually beneficial partnerships between artists and collectors.

For artists, Feral File’s NFTs create new, equitable rights and ownership models. As an artist, you can earn royalties on all secondary sales of Feral File editions into perpetuity. Additionally, when you are featured in group shows, you can trade editions of your works with one another so that you can collectively benefit if any single artist’s work increases in value.

For collectors, Feral File has established clearly defined rights for investments. As a collector, you can choose how to display your collection and you can both grant temporary rights to others and resell your purchases as you see fit. In addition, you can be sure of the provenance of your collections thanks to the use of an immutable register.

The great promise of Feral File’s NFTs is something more than just letting people buy and sell digital art. This new technology holds the potential to give artists new kinds of equity in their artwork and collectors better ways to experience, share, and resell their collections. That’s our goal.

### Technological Sustainability

We’re also ensuring that our work improves accessibility to WEB3. 

Our [Autonomy](https://autonomy.io/) digital art wallet is an easy-to-use app to securely collect, view and discover digital art you love. It provides a friendly, consumer-grade experience that provides the benefits of both web 2 (UI) and web3 (decentralization, ownership) without their weaknesses.

We release much of our software as open source and invite anyone to [contribute](https://docs.bitmark.com/meta/contribute-to-the-protocol). Our Web3 Go library for [Ethereum Smart Contracts](https://github.com/bitmark-inc/account-vault-ethereum), and our Feral File exhibition contracts are just a few of the projects that we’ve already made available for usage.

We work closely with[ Blockchain Commons](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/) to create additional infrastructure, including specifications for digital-asset wallets that you control yourself. This work can be found in Autonomy, which itself is [open source](https://github.com/bitmark-inc/autonomy-client).

### Environmental Sustainability

Feral File mints on the Tezos and Ethereum blockchains. Both of these are low-energy consumption blockchains.
