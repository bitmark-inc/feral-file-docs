### FERAL FILE ON SUSTAINABILITY

The mission of Feral File is to build a sustainable curated ecosystem for digital art, driven by the long-term interests of our artists, curators, and collectors. We focus on sustainability in the following areas:

  1. **Economic** — by creating sustainable relationships between artists and collectors, through evolution of the classic 1971 legal agreement “[The Artist’s Reserved Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Artist%27s_Reserved_Rights_Transfer_and_Sale_Agreement).”

  2. **Environmental** — by offsetting 125% of our estimated carbon impact and supporting additional measures, with the goal of being a net-positive contributor to the planet’s environment.

  3. **Technological** — by supporting open infrastructure in the same ways that facilitated the creation of TCP/IP and the Web.

Read more below to understand how we approach these issues and our commitment to sustainability. We welcome feedback from our community and will continually reassess how to improve in each area.

### Economic Sustainability

The fundamental purpose of Feral File is to reclaim digital rights for artists, who have traditionally been excluded from the financial upside when their work was resold on the secondary market; and to recognize rights for digital-art collectors, who have traditionally been given very limited (or ambiguous) authority over their purchases. This creates economic sustainability through mutually beneficial partnerships between artists and collectors.

For artists, Feral File’s NFTs create new, equitable rights and ownership models. As an artist, you can earn royalties on all secondary sales of Feral File editions into perpetuity. Additionally, when you are featured in group shows, you can trade editions of your works with one another so that you can collectively benefit if any single artist’s work increases in value.

For collectors, Feral File has established clearly defined rights for investments. As a collector, you can choose how to display your collections and you can both grant temporary rights to others and resell your purchases as you see fit. In addition, you can be sure of the provenance of your collections thanks to the use of an immutable register.

The great promise of Feral File’s NFTs is something more than just letting people buy and sell digital art. This new technology holds the potential to give artists new kinds of equity in their artwork and collectors better ways to experience, share, and resell their collections. That’s our goal.

### Environmental Sustainability

There are valid concerns over the energy costs of blockchains, which are secured by computational power. Though we believe the economic goals of Feral File are very important, we’re also aware of and working to neutralize any environmental issues.

As we wrote in a [blog post](https://medium.com/clean-titles/bitmark-blockchain-energy-usage-q-a-aeda13537228) about Bitmark’s energy usage, we have been running for a while at 160 TH/s, which currently costs upward of 55 MwH a year. That minimum level would be the equivalent to the energy usage of 12 average Americans, or to look at it in a different way, just more than the average usage of a skyscraper. It’s relatively low for a blockchain, and we think the value we give artists and collectors makes that trade-off well worthwhile. Minting a NFT on Ethereum currently requires approximately one million times more energy than doing so on the Bitmark blockchain.

However, we also want to ensure that our effect on the planet’s environment is net-positive, so Feral File, through its parent company Bitmark, offsets 125% of its estimated carbon impact from minting Feral File NFTs and the day-to-day operations of our team. We use the [US EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator) to calculate our CO2 emissions. We’re also looking to do more. We currently contribute to [Running Tide](https://www.runningtide.com/), which develops technologies to accelerate using kelp to remove carbon from the air and store it deep in the oceans. As our business grows, we will invest in other sequestration efforts, updating the community as we do, both here and through our social media communications.

Some of our NFTs do migrate to Ethereum, which can increase their energy cost in the long-term. We give our collectors and artists this choice, but look forward to future energy improvements on the Ethereum blockchain to further advance environmental sustainability.

### Technological Sustainability

We’re also ensuring that our work improves technological sustainability. The entire Internet is built upon open infrastructure: a shared, open “commons” that benefits everyone. We have many pioneers to thank for this inheritance, from the creators of the ARPANET and the designers of TCP/IP to the originator of the Web itself.

Bitmark is dedicated to continuing the support of this commons. To do so, we contribute to open infrastructure by releasing much of our software as open source under an ISC license and inviting anyone to [contribute](https://docs.bitmark.com/meta/contribute-to-the-protocol). Our Bitmark blockchain, our Web3 Swift library for Ethereum Smart Contracts, and our Feral File exhibition contracts are just a few of the projects that we’ve already made available for usage.

We are also working closely with [Blockchain Commons](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/) to create additional infrastructure, including specifications for digital-asset wallets that you control yourself. This work can be found in our own [Autonomy](https://autonomy.io/) wallet, the home for all your NFT art and other collectibles. We’ve also contributed to Blockchain Commons’ own efforts in this area with open-commons projects that we spearheaded, such as [Cosigner for Android](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-Android) and a security review of the Blockchain Commons SSKR library — all content that’s now available for usage by everyone.

### Conclusion

Fundamentally, we’re trying to build a better future at Bitmark. Feral File is doing so by empowering both artists and digital-art collectors, and in the process we’re creating technology that’s usable by anyone, so that they too can pursue some of these goals that we feel are vital to the future of the internet. Some of these technologies have environmental challenges, but with our support for environmental sustainability we intend to more than offset any costs, as we build toward even better solutions.
