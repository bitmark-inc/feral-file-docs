Feral File commissions curated exhibitions of digital artwork and we partner with artists and institutions to explore new ways of exhibiting and collecting. Evolving from the art gallery and publishing models, we are borrowing the best traits of each to inform a new kind of art space. Feral File works in tandem with a community of technologists, new media artists, collectors, and curators to redefine and frame a sustainable model for the future of digital experimentation.

### For Artists

1. Exhibiting with Feral File enables artists to connect with a community of peers, and engage with their work. Group exhibitions frequently feature trades in which each artist receives an artist edition (AE) from the other artists in their exhibition.
2. We support a wide array of media formats, so that artists can create in the medium and fidelity they choose. Feral File supports minting on Ethereum or Tezos.
3. Feral File makes it easy for both artists and collectors to understand their rights. We have evolved the pioneering 1971 [“Artist's Reserved Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement”](https://feralfile.com/close-ups/digital-property-rights-with-bitmark-nfts-evolving-the-artist-reserved-rights-transfer-and-sale-agreement) for the digital age, using smart contacts to record each edition, provenance and collect royalties – even for cross-blockchain transactions.

### For Collectors

1. Feral File makes collecting art more accessible. It embraces the edition model to offer works across a wide range of prices and accepts credit cards and cryptocurrencies.
2. We have two types of accounts, one in which we hold your assets (custodial), and one in which you hold them (web3 / self-custody) in your own wallet.
3. The Feral File team built Autonomy, the world’s first and only digital art wallet. It gives you one easy-to-use app to securely collect, view and discover digital art you love. Autonomy works with Ethereum and Tezos (and of course all Feral File) NFTs on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/autonomy-app/id1544022728) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitmark.autonomy_client&hl=en_US&gl=US).

### For Art Enthusiasts and Researchers

1. Feral File also acts as a public archive of digital exhibitions, expressions, and ideas. Curatorial statements and press releases are valuable reference materials for the purpose of educational research.
2. [Close-Ups](https://feralfile.com/close-ups), highlights conversations between curators and artists that detail processes, studio practices, and the extended possibilities of exhibiting art online.
3. We are actively working on programs to bring Feral File to educational institutions and physical spaces to reach broader audiences. [Contact us](https://feralfile.com/docs/contact) if you are interested.
