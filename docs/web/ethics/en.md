EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION IN FERAL FILE SALES

No set of guidelines can account for every scenario. From principles, Bitmark employees may not use their influence to guide exhibitions for their personal benefit.

From July 2023, Bitmark employees are able to participate in exhibition sales alongside the public. Previously, Bitmark employees were not able to participate in group auctions due to the potential for access to non-public bidding information. Since this date, Bitmark has revised ways of working and this potential conflict of interest has been resolved.
