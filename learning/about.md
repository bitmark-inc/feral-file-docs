# Feral File is redefining how digital art is experienced.

Through thoughtful curation, purpose-built technology, and a commitment to accessibility, Feral File creates a seamless bridge between artists and audiences—making digital art a personal, meaningful, and enduring part of everyday life.

Feral File’s mission is to bring digital art beyond galleries and into daily life. We champion artists’ ambition and excellence, fostering deeper connections between their work and the public.

Founded in 2020 by artist [Casey Reas](https://reas.com/) and technologist [Sean Moss-Pultz](https://einstein-rosen.com), Feral File builds on their long-standing collaboration. It evolved from a2p (2019), an early experiment exploring digital artworks with secure provenance and artist-to-artist exchange. With Feral File, we expanded beyond artist networks to create a platform where collectors, institutions, and the public could engage with digital art in entirely new ways.

Since then, Feral File has championed digital art as an essential part of contemporary culture, supporting artists exploring code, interactivity, and generative processes while pioneering new collecting models that cultivate a thriving global community.


## Highlights from Feral File’s history


### 2024



* In February, Feral File collaborated with artist Sebastien Devaud (aka Agoria), fx(hash), and The Tezos Foundation to showcase *[Σ Lumina](https://feralfile.com/research-and-development/le-code-dorsay)*, an original blockchain-based artwork, inside the historic Musée d’Orsay—a first for the institution.
* In March, the exhibition *[SOUND MACHINES](https://feralfile.com/exhibitions/sound-machines-xz1)*, curated by MoMA, explored sound as a digital medium. For the show, featured artist Yoko Ono reconceived her earlier work *SOUND PIECE V* (1996/2024) as a digital, on-chain interactive piece inviting public participation.
* On the summer solstice, Feral File launched *[crystalline work (arctic)](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/crystalline-work-5ze)* by John Gerrard. This 365-day data performance depicts a virtual robot generating unique ice crystal formations at the Arctic North Pole, culminating on June 21, 2025. Twenty-five percent of sales revenues support Hometree, an Irish reforestation project.
* In September, *[Patterns of Flow](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/liu-renopatan-patterns-of-flow-nhk)*—an exhibition celebrating a new generation of Japanese digital artists—was presented both online and as a physical installation at NEORT++ in Tokyo. Jasia Reichardt, a pioneer in early digital art curation, contributed a foreword drawing connections between avant-garde movements and contemporary generative art.
* In December, Feral File featured *[E-volved Formulae](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/e-volved-formulae-8an)* by Driessens & Verstappen, a pioneering generative art duo. Their custom software “bred” mathematical formulas in a process of variation and selection that mimics human evolution. Academic and writer Mitchell Whitehall provided a foreword, *A Different Way*, contextualizing the software within the AI landscape and the artists’ broader practice.


### 2023



* In March, *[Chain Reaction](https://feralfile.com/exhibitions/chain-reaction-tan)*, curated by Christiane Paul, Curator of Digital Art at The Whitney Museum of American Art, examined digital art’s evolving relationship with blockchain. That same month, Feral File presented *[Lee Mullican.PCX](https://feralfile.com/exhibitions/leemullican-pcx-ff8)*, its first exhibition produced with an artist’s estate, showcasing pioneering computer-generated works from the 1980s.
* In May, we launched *[Data Universe Burn](https://feralfile.com/research-and-development/data-universe-burn)*, a blockchain-based project developed as a way for Refik Anadol to provide a special thank-you to collectors following the success of *[Unsupervised](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/unsupervised-sla)*.
* In June, Feral File marked its second anniversary with two exhibitions:
    * *[The Experiment](https://retrospective.feralfile.com/the-experiment-6jy)*, reflecting on the genesis of *a2p*.
    * *[FF1.0](https://retrospective.feralfile.com/ff1)*, which reintroduced one artwork from each of the 33 exhibitions hosted on the platform over its first two years.
* In September, *[SOURCE](https://feralfile.com/exhibitions/source)* became Feral File’s first non-commercial exhibition.
* In October, the [MoMA Postcard](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5618) Project launched, described as “an experiment in collective creativity on the blockchain, [and] an invitation for anyone to learn, experiment, collaborate, and create value together.”


### 2022



* In May, *[On Screen Presence](https://feralfile.com/exhibitions/on-screen-presence-kpb)*, curated by Regina Harsanyi, explored digital art’s relationship with the screen. The show featured 0xDEAFBEEF, John F. Simon Jr., Wiena Lin, Golan Levin, and Molly Soda.
* In July, *[gämma](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/gamma-mev)*, a solo exhibition by p1xelfool curated by Kerry Doran, marked Feral File’s first show on the Tezos blockchain.
* In November, *[Gray Matter](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/gray-matter-dn1)*, curated by Gaia Bobò, featured Auriea Harvey’s 3D sculpture and became Feral File’s first exhibition on Ethereum.
* Also in November, *[Peer to Peer](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/peer-to-peer-pjb)*, curated by Tina Rivers Ryan, was exhibited. All artworks from this exhibition were later acquired into the Buffalo AKG Art Museum’s permanent collection.


### 2021



* In March, *[Social Codes](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/social-codes-pcl)*, Feral File’s first official exhibition, was presented, featuring artists such as Andrew Benson, LIA, Dmitri Cherniak, Raven Kwok, Anna Carreras, Manolo Gamboa Naon, Maya Man, Frederik Vanhoutte, Saskia Freeke, and Dave Whyte.
* In October, *[Reflections in the Water](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/reflections-in-the-water-9ov)*, a group show curated by Luba Elliott, examined AI-generated art nearly a year before Stable Diffusion was released.
* In November, *[Unsupervised](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/unsupervised-sla)*, a solo exhibition by Refik Anadol, debuted. The show led to *Unsupervised* being installed at MoMA and later acquired into the museum’s permanent collection.
* That same month, *[–GRAPH](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/graph-eg6)* introduced generative and physical plotter works by artists such as Aleksandra Jovanić, Iskra Velitchkova, James Merrill, Julien Gachadoat, Licia He, and Tyler Hobbs.


### 2020



* In spring, *[a2p #2](https://a2p.bitmark.com/v2/artworks)* expanded the initial exhibition into a broader experiment, bringing together nearly 150 artists—many of whom are now among the most influential voices in digital art. For many participants, this was their first encounter with blockchain as a medium, introducing new possibilities for provenance and artistic exchange.
* By summer, the first internal documents outlining Feral File’s vision were developed, transitioning *a2p* from an artist-led experiment into a fully realized platform for distributing, displaying, and collecting digital art.


### 2019



* In 2019, *[a2p](https://a2p.bitmark.com/v1/artworks)* (short for “artist-to-peer”) launched, curated by Casey Reas alongside Addie Wagenknecht, Rick Silva, and exonemo. This speculative exhibition explored new ways of distributing and sharing digital artwork.
* More than an exhibition, *a2p* was a proof of concept, demonstrating how digital artworks could be exchanged with secure provenance on the blockchain. As Casey Reas later reflected, “*a2p* was a moment of collaboration and calm before the storm that shifted the history of digital art.”
