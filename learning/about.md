# Feral File is redefining how digital art is experienced.

We work closely with artists, curators, and institutions to present curated exhibitions of code-based, interactive, and time-based work. Every show is thoughtfully assembled, and every tool we build is designed to support how digital art actually behaves—dynamic, distributed, often collaborative. We help collectors engage with it in ways that are meaningful, sustainable, and grounded in care.

Founded in 2020 by artist [Casey Reas](https://reas.com/) and technologist [Sean Moss-Pultz](https://einstein-rosen.com), Feral File began as a continuation of their earlier project, a2p (2019)—an artist-to-artist experiment in exchange and provenance. From there, it grew into a broader space for artists, collectors, institutions, and the public to come together around digital art.

Since then, we’ve collaborated with leading institutions and supported artists working across generative systems, emerging formats, and new modes of sharing work. Our aim is to make digital art part of daily life—collected, cared for, and lived with.


## Highlights from Feral File’s history

### 2024

* In February, Feral File collaborated with artist Sebastien Devaud (aka Agoria), fx(hash), and The Tezos Foundation to present *[Σ Lumina](https://feralfile.com/research-and-development/le-code-dorsay)* inside the Musée d’Orsay—the institution’s first blockchain-based artwork.
* In March, *[SOUND MACHINES](https://feralfile.com/exhibitions/sound-machines-xz1)*, curated by MoMA, explored sound as a digital medium. Featured artist Yoko Ono reimagined her earlier work *SOUND PIECE V* (1996/2024) as an on-chain interactive piece inviting public participation.
* On the summer solstice, Feral File launched *[crystalline work (arctic)](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/crystalline-work-5ze)* by John Gerrard—a 365-day data performance depicting a virtual robot generating ice crystal formations at the North Pole. The work will conclude on June 21, 2025, with 25% of sales supporting Irish reforestation nonprofit Hometree.
* In September, *[Patterns of Flow](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/liu-renopatan-patterns-of-flow-nhk)* celebrated a new generation of Japanese digital artists, presented online and as a physical installation at NEORT++ in Tokyo. Jasia Reichardt contributed a foreword linking avant-garde histories to contemporary generative art.
* In December, Feral File presented *[E-volved Formulae](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/e-volved-formulae-8an)* by Driessens & Verstappen. Their custom software “bred” mathematical formulas through variation and selection, echoing human evolution. Mitchell Whitehall’s foreword, *A Different Way*, contextualized the work within both AI discourse and the duo’s broader practice.

### 2023

* In March, *[Chain Reaction](https://feralfile.com/exhibitions/chain-reaction-tan)*, curated by Christiane Paul (Whitney Museum of American Art), examined digital art’s evolving relationship with blockchain. That same month, *[Lee Mullican.PCX](https://feralfile.com/exhibitions/leemullican-pcx-ff8)*, Feral File’s first collaboration with an artist’s estate, reintroduced Mullican’s 1980s computer-generated work to new audiences.
* In May, Refik Anadol launched *[Data Universe Burn](https://feralfile.com/research-and-development/data-universe-burn)*—a blockchain-based thank-you to collectors following the success of *[Unsupervised](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/unsupervised-sla)*.
* In June, Feral File marked its second anniversary with two exhibitions: *[The Experiment](https://retrospective.feralfile.com/the-experiment-6jy)*, reflecting on the origins of *a2p*, and *[FF1.0](https://retrospective.feralfile.com/ff1)*, which revisited one work from each of our first 33 exhibitions.
* In September, *[SOURCE](https://feralfile.com/exhibitions/source)* became Feral File’s first non-commercial exhibition.
* In October, MoMA launched the [Postcard Project](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5618): an experiment in collective creativity on the blockchain, inviting public collaboration and participation.

### 2022

* In May, *[On Screen Presence](https://feralfile.com/exhibitions/on-screen-presence-kpb)*, curated by Regina Harsanyi, explored the screen’s role in digital art. Featured artists included 0xDEAFBEEF, John F. Simon Jr., Wiena Lin, Golan Levin, and Molly Soda.
* In July, *[gämma](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/gamma-mev)*, a solo show by p1xelfool curated by Kerry Doran, became our first exhibition on the Tezos blockchain.
* In November, *[Gray Matter](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/gray-matter-dn1)*, curated by Gaia Bobò, featured Auriea Harvey’s 3D sculpture and marked our first Ethereum-based exhibition.
* That same month, *[Peer to Peer](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/peer-to-peer-pjb)*, curated by Tina Rivers Ryan, was exhibited; all artworks were later acquired by the Buffalo AKG Art Museum.

### 2021

* In March, *[Social Codes](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/social-codes-pcl)*, Feral File’s first official exhibition, launched with artists including Andrew Benson, LIA, Dmitri Cherniak, Maya Man, Manolo Gamboa Naon, and Dave Whyte.
* In October, *[Reflections in the Water](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/reflections-in-the-water-9ov)*, curated by Luba Elliott, examined AI-generated art nearly a year before Stable Diffusion’s public release.
* In November, Refik Anadol’s *[Unsupervised](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/unsupervised-sla)* premiered. The work was later installed at MoMA and acquired into the museum’s permanent collection.
* That same month, *[–GRAPH](https://feralfile.com/explore/exhibitions/graph-eg6)* featured generative plotter works by artists including Iskra Velitchkova, Julien Gachadoat, Licia He, and Tyler Hobbs.

### 2020

* In spring, *[a2p #2](https://a2p.bitmark.com/v2/artworks)* expanded the original concept into a large-scale, artist-driven experiment involving nearly 150 participants—many of whom were engaging with blockchain for the first time.
* By summer, internal planning for Feral File began, transitioning *a2p* from an artist-led project into a dedicated initiative for exhibiting and collecting digital art.

### 2019

* In 2019, *[a2p](https://a2p.bitmark.com/v1/artworks)* (short for “artist-to-peer”), curated by Casey Reas with Addie Wagenknecht, Rick Silva, and exonemo, explored new ways of distributing and exchanging digital work.
* More than an exhibition, *a2p* served as a proof of concept—demonstrating how digital artworks could be exchanged with secure provenance on the blockchain. As Casey Reas later reflected, “*a2p* was a moment of collaboration and calm before the storm that shifted the history of digital art.”
