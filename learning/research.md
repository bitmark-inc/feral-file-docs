# Research

At Feral File, we explore new ways of engaging with digital art—through time-based works, collaborative experiments, and blockchain as a creative medium.

We’ve worked with artists and institutions to test ideas that go beyond the traditional exhibition format. These projects often explore how art can unfold over time, respond to communities, or live on-chain. For us, blockchain isn’t just infrastructure—it’s a tool for expanding what art can do and how it can be experienced.
