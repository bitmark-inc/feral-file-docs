# Research

At Feral File, we experiment with new ways to engage with art—exploring time-based works, community-driven projects, and blockchain as a creative tool.

We’ve partnered with renowned artists and cultural institutions to push the boundaries of collaborative digital expression. We support projects that test new models of engagement and believe blockchain offers a powerful medium for expanding the possibilities of collective creativity.
