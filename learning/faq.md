# Frequently asked questions

## Collection

### What does it mean to collect an artwork?
Collecting a Feral File artwork grants you a specific set of property rights to your artwork as well as access to the artwork files themselves. You can explore these rights in Feral File Artist + Collector Rights. Collecting a work also gives you access to its original, high-quality files and source code (in the case of software-based works), which you can download, display, and even loan to others.

### Where are Feral File artworks stored?
Feral File has its own longer-term storage which is mirrored over IPFS, a distributed file system. These IPFS resource endpoints are contained in your artworks’ smart contract metadata. You can also download the artwork files for any artwork you own by selecting the artwork in your collection then clicking “Download Artwork.”

### How can I view my artwork on Feral File if I purchase the edition on another platform?
After purchasing a Feral File artwork on another platform, create a Feral File account by connecting your web3 wallet. You can then access and download your artworks from your collection.
