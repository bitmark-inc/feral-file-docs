# Frequently asked questions

### Collection

#### What does it mean to collect an artwork?
Collecting a Feral File artwork grants you a specific set of property rights to your artwork as well as access to the artwork files themselves. You can explore these rights in [Feral File Artist + Collector Rights](https://feralfile.com/legal/artist-collector-rights). Collecting a work also gives you access to its original, high-quality files and source code (in the case of software-based works), which you can download, display, and even loan to others.

#### Where are Feral File artworks stored?
Feral File has its own longer-term storage which is mirrored over IPFS, a distributed file system. These IPFS resource endpoints are contained in your artworks’ smart contract metadata. You can also download the artwork files for any artwork you own by selecting the artwork in your collection then clicking “Download Artwork.”

#### How can I view my artwork on Feral File if I purchase the edition on another platform?
After purchasing a Feral File artwork on another platform, create a Feral File account by connecting your web3 wallet. You can then access and download your artworks from your collection.

### Payment

#### Is it better to pay with cryptocurrency or credit card?
Collectors do not receive any advantage or priority whether they use credit cards or cryptocurrency for payment.

#### I am having issues buying with my credit card. What can I do?
We use Stripe's Hong Kong division to process credit card payments. As a result, your credit card company may ask you to verify transactions coming from Feral File before authorizing the purchase. You can prevent most issues by letting them know you are making a transaction in Hong Kong.

### Auctions

#### How do auctions work?
Feral File supports two different auction formats to collect exhibition sets: falling-price auctions and highest-bid auctions. The curator and artists for each exhibition choose the most appropriate auction format for collecting their exhibition sets.

In a falling-price auction, the auction starts at a specific price then falls to a final "base" price over a duration of 30 minutes. Bidding earlier (at a higher price) gives you a greater chance to collect the exact sets you want. If all sets are not sold in the first 30 minutes, the remaining sets are sold at the base price for the next 23.5 hours. At the end of the 24-hour auction period, any remaining sets are removed from sale at Feral File.

In a highest-bid auction, the auction starts at a reserve price for each exhibition set with bidders attempting to outbid one another to win the set. The person with the highest bid at the end of the auction wins the set. Bids must always be higher than the current highest bid, and all bids placed are public and cannot be withdrawn. A highest-bid auction lasts for 24 hours. To prevent bid sniping, a bid placed within the last 5 minutes of the auction extends the auction period by 10 additional minutes. Sets that receive no bids are removed from sale at Feral File when the auction closes.

#### What are a2p sets?
As a continuation of Feral File’s origins in the [a2p (“artist-to-peer”) experiment](https://a2p.bitmark.com/), all artists in a group exhibition swap works with one another. The lowest-numbered sets from each exhibition are automatically reserved for the curators, artists, and Feral File archive. For example, if an exhibition has one curator and eight artists, set #1 will be reserved for the curator, sets #2 through #9 for the artists, and set #10 for the Feral File archive.

#### What happens to artworks after the 24 hour sale period?
After 24 hours, unsold sets will no longer be available on Feral File. The artworks may be sold through private transactions to collectors or institutions over time or may even be burned, based on artist preference for each exhibition.

### Join Feral File

#### I’m an artist. Can I sell my work on Feral File?
Feral File artists are selected for each exhibition by that show’s curator. We don’t currently have a way for artists to upload work directly to Feral File or to be considered for selection by curators.

#### I’m a curator. How can I curate a future exhibition?
Become part of our next wave of curators through our open call for proposals!
