# Collector Services

We work with collectors to help them acquire, care for, and display digital art—confidentially and with attention to detail.

Whether you're building a collection, selling a piece, or looking to safeguard or show what you already have, we offer tailored support rooted in both technical knowledge and curatorial insight.

### What We Offer

1. **Acquisitions**  
   We help you identify and secure digital artworks that align with your vision. All transactions are handled with care and discretion.

2. **Private Sales**  
   Looking to part with a work? We help connect you with the right buyers and manage the process from start to finish.

3. **Custody and Safekeeping**  
   We work with trusted partners to keep your collection secure—now and in the long term.

4. **Display Solutions**  
   From screens to custom installations, we’ll help you turn your collection into an experience, whether at home, in a gallery, or elsewhere.

5. **Liquidity and Licensing**  
   We can help you unlock value from your collection—through secure loans or by licensing access in a way that preserves your ownership and intent.
