We recommend creating two versions of your video for Feral File. One version is for web streaming and the other version is the highest resolution you have to be downloaded by the collector.

*If you want to have the MP4 for streaming and a high-resolution version, and other materials for the collector, you‚Äôll upload the MP4 and separately upload a ZIP file for the collector to download. Here‚Äôs an example ZIP file format.*

2. Web streaming: The compressed version of your video for web steaming must be no greater than 500MB per file, and it must be a MP4. (This is the video that users will see when they click ‚Äú[Artwork](https://feralfile.com/exhibitions/sound-machines-xz1/series/play-from-memory-xyq?viewMode=Grid&artPlayTokenIndex=0)‚Äù). *Format example: [Web streaming Preview folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c5fiEiekG4OBfQWaLlXUVR5WYkztTMKk?usp=share_link)*
