### Instructions for 3D Artwork Submission

* We‚Äôve decided to make 3D uploads the same as the Software category. This offers each artist the most flexibility in how their work is displayed. Upload a ZIP file with an index.html at the top of the ZIP. See the ‚Äú3D Upload Details‚Äù section below. 
* Include all 3D files you want the collector to have access to within the ZIP
* Include other information, such as text, process images, etc. you want the collector to have within the ZIP. The ZIP upload has a 5GB limit.
* The <modelviewer> tag is the a default way to create a 3D edition
    * The basics: https://modelviewer.dev/
    * Explore examples: https://modelviewer.dev/examples/loading/index.html
    * Generate your files: https://modelviewer.dev/editor/
* Feral File can wrap these files into Electron applications to allow the collector to download Linux, Windows, and Mac OS applications to view your files on their computers.

### 3D Upload Details

Examples: [Sophie Khan](https://feralfile.com/artworks/spectrality-from-the-divers-ix-kkw), [Auriea Harvey](https://feralfile.com/exhibitions/peer-to-peer-pjb/series/auriea-harvey-9kg?viewMode=Grid), [Carla Gannis](https://feralfile.com/artworks/peep-o-rama-r4s)

The <modelviewer> tag and a GLB file are the default way to create a 3D edition for Feral File. If you use the URL [https://modelviewer.dev/editor/](https://modelviewer.dev/editor/) to create your files, things will look like this: 

üìÅ my_artwork.zip
* index.html (generated from the link above, required at the root of the ZIP)
* [model-viewer.min.js](https://unpkg.com/@google/model-viewer@1.7.2/dist/model-viewer.min.js) (very important! all files must be inside the ZIP and not linking out to other sites online. this isn‚Äôt downloaded by default. click the link to get the file)
* script.js (generated from the link above)
* styles.css (generated from the link above)
* snippet.txt (generated from the link above)
* my_model.glb
* maybe_a_PDF_with_other_information.pdf
* maybe_a_README_file_with_other_information.txt
* üìÅ maybe_other? (if you want to include your model in other formats)
    * my_model.stl
    * my_model.usdz
    * my_model.dae
    * my_model.obj
    * etc.
* üìÅ maybe_a_video?
    * my_artwork.mov

Your edition can‚Äôt require any external resources or servers to operate. The entire work must be contained within this ZIP. 

***** When you create the ZIP, select the files and make the ZIP; don‚Äôt ZIP the folder that encloses the files. After the ZIP is created, you can rename it.

***** Sometimes the Feral File code can‚Äôt recognize this type of file automatically, so the MIME type needs to be set manually by Bitmark. If your artwork isn‚Äôt working a few minutes after uploading, please tag @rita in your exhibition channel on Discord. This only takes a few minutes, but because of the time zone, it sometimes takes hours for the engineers to see the request.

If you need help with 3D model format, you can email Oren directly ([oren.avraham.shoham@gmail.com](mailto:oren.avraham.shoham@gmail.com)).

This is Oren's fee structure:

For a 3D viewer website made with [https://modelviewer.dev](https://modelviewer.dev/) displaying a single model (similar to what I set up for Peter's COUNT ZERO FOUR piece), I'd ask for a $500 flat fee, which would include helping the artist convert their model to GLB format and configuring the &lt;model-viewer> camera and controls. If an artist wanted something more complex than what &lt;model-viewer> affords, e.g. a site with custom HTML/CSS, custom interaction logic, multiple 3D models, or JavaScript-based animation, or if they needed help with a pre-existing 3D viewer setup, I'd charge an hourly rate of $60.
