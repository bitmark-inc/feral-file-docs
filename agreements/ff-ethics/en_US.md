Employee Participation in Feral File Sales

We are committed to fairness and transparency in all exhibition sales. Feral File employees may not use their position to influence exhibitions for personal gain.

Feral File employees are allowed to participate in exhibition sales alongside the public. Previously, employees were restricted from group auctions due to access to non-public bidding information. However, with the adoption of smart contract-based auctions, all transactions are now conducted transparently on-chain, ensuring a level playing field for all participants.
