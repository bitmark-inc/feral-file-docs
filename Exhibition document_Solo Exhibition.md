# Feral File — Exhibition Document (Solo Exhibition)

This document is designed to collect all essential details from the curator and artist(s) participating in a solo exhibition on Feral File. Its purpose is to ensure that all required information is organized in one place, facilitating smooth planning and execution of the exhibition.

Once the document is completed, a copy editor from Feral File will review and edit the text directly in the Google document, providing suggestions for improvement. The curator will then need to review and resolve these suggestions. After final approval, Feral File will input the finalized text into the admin platform.
