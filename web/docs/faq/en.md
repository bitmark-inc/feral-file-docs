### Your Collection

#### What does it mean to collect a work?

Collecting a work on Feral File gives you property rights to the files you collect. All Feral File editions, regardless of the blockchain they are minted on, combine the media with a property-rights contract. Once you purchase a work, you have access to the original, high-quality files and you can download, display, and even resell, loan, or gift them. If you collect a software edition, you may have access to the source code, too. All editions collected on Feral File grant the owner a “bundle of rights,” which are detailed in the[ Artist + Collector Rights](https://feralfile.com/docs/artist-collector-rights) document.


#### Where are Feral File editions stored?

Feral File has its own longer-term storage which is then mirrored over IPFS, a distributed file system. You can see the links in the metadata of the smart contracts for your NFTs. You can also download your editions and provide your own backup.


#### How can I view my artwork on Feral File if I purchase the edition on another platform?

Once you have purchased a Feral File edition on another platform, create a Feral File account and connect it to your crypto wallet. You can then access your editions and their respective collector packages [within your collection](https://feralfile.com/collection).



### Payment

#### Is it better to pay with cryptocurrency or credit card?

Collectors do not receive any advantage or priority whether they use credit cards or cryptocurrency for payment.


#### I am having issues buying with my credit card. What can I do?

We use Stripe's Hong Kong division to process credit card payments. As a result, your credit card company may ask you to verify transactions coming from Feral File before authorizing the purchase. You can prevent most issues by letting them know you are making a transaction in Hong Kong.



### Auctions

#### What does it mean that my funds are reserved after I make a bid?

When you are bidding in an auction, the funds that you bid are unavailable for other usage until you are outbid (highest-bid auctions) or the auction ends. You cannot cancel a bid, but you can raise it. 


#### What is a highest-bid auction?

In a highest-bid auction, you can make a bid greater than the current bid value for an item and then become the new winning bidder. The person with the highest winning bid at the end of the auction gets to collect the edition.


#### What is a group auction?

In a group auction, several editions of the same artwork or set are auctioned together. A collector bids to win one of the editions in the lot, and editions are awarded to the highest bidders. Every winner pays the amount of the lowest winning bid, or the “floor bid.” 

For example, an artist might offer three editions of an artwork in a group auction and receive five collector bids of $1, $2, $3, $4, and $5. The $5, $4, and $3 bids are the winners, and all three winners each pay $3 for their editions - $3 is the price of the lowest winning bid, the clearing price for all the editions in the lot.

The time of the bid determines which edition number the bidder wins. Earlier winning bids will receive lower-numbered editions than later winning bids, regardless of the amount of the bids. Any bid that is updated during the auction process receives the timestamp of the most recent bid.
