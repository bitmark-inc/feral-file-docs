EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION IN FERAL FILE SALES

No set of guidelines can account for every scenario. From principles, Bitmark employees may not use their influence to guide exhibitions for their personal benefit.

From July 2023, Bitmark employees are able to participate in exhibition sales alongside the public. Previously, employees were not able to participate in group auctions because they had access to non-public bidding information. However, with falling price auctions, there is no longer non-public bidding information.
