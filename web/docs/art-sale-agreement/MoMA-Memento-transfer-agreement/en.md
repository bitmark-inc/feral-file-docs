**“Digital Property”** means a Memento and Associated Information, recorded together within a Memento NFT, in a Public Blockchain.

**“Public Blockchain”** means a distributed, publicly available registry and ledger system which uses blockchain technology to allow holders of an account on such system (consisting of a public and private key pair) to create unique records (the NFT Memento) to claim access to Mementos identified in the Memento NFT.
