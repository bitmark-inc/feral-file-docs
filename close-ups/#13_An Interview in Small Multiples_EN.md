On the occasion of [Field Guide](https://feralfile.com/exhibitions/field-guide-sss) — Evolution in Small Multiples, curator Artnome - Jason Bailey initiates a novel type of short form interview with the exhibition’s artists.

<sub>These exchanges took place over email in January of 2022.</sub>

When the pandemic hit and all exhibitions moved online for a brief period of time, it felt like we lost the opportunity to connect with the artists in real life as people. For this exhibition, I decided to create a rapid-fire interview through a series of short questions and answers to try and capture some of the “getting-to-know-you” banter that occurs after a glass (or three) of wine at a gallery opening.

The result is a short form interview intended to mirror the visual concept of small multiples in written form. Conceived of by Edward Tufte, small multiples display a set of images in close proximity to each other, in order to facilitate comparisons across the full group of images at a glance — a concept that [features prominently](https://feralfile.com/exhibitions/field-guide-sss) in the exhibition. The idea here is to quickly provide some more background, insight, and color into who the artists participating in the show are as people. It’s meant to be lighthearted and fun and written in a format similar to what one might find in a field guide.
