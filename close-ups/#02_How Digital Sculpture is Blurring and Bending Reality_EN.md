# How Digital Sculpture is Blurring and Bending Reality

Curator Julie Walsh on using art to jump between dimensions, being playful with the concept of ownership, and how artists are decloaking the NFT format.

This conversation happened on May 5, 2021 between Julie Walsh—the curator of [The Bardo: Unpacking the Real](https://feralfile.com/exhibitions/the-bardo-unpacking-the-real-a2j)—and editor Willa Köerner.

**Can you walk us through the top-level ideas in the exhibition you’ve curated for Feral File, The Bardo: Unpacking the Real?**

“The Bardo” refers to a liminal state where we are put to the important task of figuring out what is real versus what is unreal. When we’re able to recognize imagery and sounds as unreal or self-created, we are then able to transcend the Bardo into enlightenment. In a similar way, viewing “unreal” digital sculpture can bring up questions about our blended realities, and help us interpret what’s “real” outside of binary terms.

In many cases, the artists in this exhibition are translating IRL (“in real life”) objects into the liminal space of the internet. The sculptural work in this show walks a fine line in terms of what we call “reality.” For example, if a 3D model can be 3D printed, in my mind, that’s a way of jumping between realities. In Buddhism they say, “We are always in a Bardo, or a state of becoming.” You could also say that digital art is in a constant state of becoming.

**What draws you to digital sculpture in particular, and to works that prod at our concept of reality?**

Digital sculpture is a topic that I’ve been quite obsessed with lately. It is fascinating to me how the trajectory of sculpture-making throughout time has evolved in many ways—but also stayed the same. It always starts with a person who is inspired by something, and then uses their imagination and their hands to work with clay, or wood, or any other medium, to create form. With digital sculpture, it’s a very similar process—except they’re translating whatever inspired them into an “unreal” format.

The first time I engaged with digital sculpture, it was like a light going off in my mind. As somebody who had a gallery for 18 years and did many, many exhibitions of sculpture in real life, the idea that you could take an ephemeral file and have this very intimate, personal encounter with a sculptural object in an entirely new kind of space felt remarkable to me.

Artist Auriea Harvey, for example, has a long history of creating physical sculptures, and her digital work takes physical, real objects and scans them into 3D models. In this way, she creates this fusion between real-life objects and their digital counterparts. As another example, Sophie Kahn’s work explores what happens when you take a 3D object, laser scan it, and then transmit that data into a digital space, asking questions like, “What is lost? How does the work translate?” Similarly, Martina Menegon’s work explores notions of reality and truth, and digs into how those concepts change with digitalization and technology. I find these kinds of reality-bending explorations thrilling.

With so many of the artists in this exhibit, their digital sculptures are meant to be enjoyed in new ways. Fundamentally, they are something you can engage with—something you can put on your desktop, something you can interact with by turning it upside-down, or even entering it, in the case of Carla Gannis’ “peep-o-rama” piece. And Matthew D. Gantts’ piece is quite interesting, as you’re able to move through a virtual environment while listening to sound sculptures that, while completely ephemeral, are based on distortions of real instruments. I think it’s this sense of limitlessness in terms of how you can interact with these formats that is so fascinating to me.

**Where do you see digital sculpture heading? Are there certain trends you’re starting to see emerge now that you think will continue to develop?**

In the future, I think we’re going to see more and more of these blended realities—like when you have a traditional sculpture exhibited in real life, and there’s also an augmented reality overlay on it. With that kind of experience, your phone lets you see an entirely new part of the sculpture that you wouldn’t be able to access if you were just looking at it with your eyes. This trend of using art and technology to blend physical and digital realities is something that will continue to evolve and grow.
