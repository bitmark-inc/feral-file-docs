**杰西．达米亚尼（以下简称「达米亚尼」）：** 艾丽斯，妳经常接触的艺术家所运用的媒材从模拟跨到数字，包罗万象。是否可以跟我们谈谈，就妳的观察，新媒体艺术家和他们所用的媒材之间的关系，有什么特别之处？

**艾丽斯．格雷．斯泰茨（以下简称「斯泰茨」）：** 媒材是一切的开始，这和用传统媒材创作的艺术家是很像的。在我看来，透过自己在使用的媒材去思考，让素材本身去传达出心中构想或想象（或它们最终会具现的样子）的创作者，是「视觉艺术家」的一种定义方式。那么，再来谈用新媒体创作的艺术家，这时我会想到在我们位于辛辛那提的21c博物馆里，有一件阿斯特丽德．克罗（Astrid Krogh）利用纤维光学加上客制彩色转轮构成的巨型挂毯装置。看她在工作室里的织布机上编织光导纤维，加上作品对它的装置环境、对博物馆的建筑结构、对来往人群的感受将会造成的影响，都是作品得以实现的原因。这就很像亲眼看到一个人在雕刻木头或大理石，那是过程在和最后成品的形式和功能对话。同样的情况也适用在那些用数字动画创作的艺术家身上，看他们一层一层地把颜色和形式迭加起来，像是克里斯．杜尔（Chris Doyle）的作品──看他从程序代码一直发展到最后的成果。学习去聆听那个语言，和去听见那个语言，大幅提升了我作为一个策展人的鉴赏力。

另外，运用新工具、新形态、新方法去和作品互动交流，来完成各种不同的目的和表现的艺术家，也是我思考的对象。我想到的是雅各布布布．库德斯克．斯廷森（Jakob Kudsk Steensen），我们大约在六、七年前开始收藏他的作品──他那本质上以程序代码和研究为基础发展出来的作品，陆续以不同的样态出现。第一件作品是高画质影片，后来变成一个交互式的VR体验──都是在探讨环境、环境恶化、资源滥用、对物种的威胁……那些作品变得好有说服力。他还将某些VR体验做适度的调整后，重新套用到影片里，让更多的观众可以和作品接触。有些前期开始使用新科技的艺术家，尝试以不同的方式运用这些工具，以求触及更广大的观众群，这种创新和研发的精神是我很乐见的，而我们也会从中隐约看到这些过程的演进与发展。

**达米亚尼：** 乔尔，你的工作中很大的成分，是和艺术家一同走过作品的发展阶段，这是很特别的。可以和我们分享那样的经验吗？参与艺术家的创作发展历程大概是什么样子？感觉如何？对于没有这种管道的一般大众来说，有什么可能是他们想象不到的吗？

**乔尔．费里（以下简称「费里」）：** 我们机构很看重实验性和反复执行的精神，项目发展的过程通常都是创意喷发、行云流水。这种不设定结果的开放式思维可能不太容易遵循或适应，而在获得我们的奖助的人之中，有些很坚持要照原订计划走，完全不接受变通。有些则在我们这个空间如鱼得水。说到底，和民众的接触，对不确定性能够保持平常心，都是关键。我们经常会和其他单位合作或协作，来为一项计划拓展出更大更广的平台，但这就不免要放弃一些主导权。在原始的《洛杉矶郡立美术馆出版艺术与科技项目，1967年－1971年》（Art and Technology Program of the Los Angeles Country Museum of Art, 1967-1971）专刊里面（页269），有一份克拉斯．欧登伯格（Claes Oldenburg）做的表，很经典，用来解说「一位艺术家为了在企业科技竞技场上游刃有余而必须历经的改变」。我们机构的合作对象并非全是企业，但这个表也实在是拳拳到位。

**JD:** I hope this exhibition gives glimpses into the practices of new media artists in part to counter the misperception that their work is automated, mostly authored by machines. Can you speak to the degree of craft and human labor involved in creating this kind of work? Or maybe to the types of engagement that these artists have with their digital/technological materials?

**AGS:** In digital art in particular, because the final product often appears on your screen, there’s a sense that it’s just magic, that there isn’t the degree of labor in other art forms. I think of the artist Quayola, and trying to explain how his work is really complex data visualization. The way I often explain it to people is that he is using technological tools, computer-based software, and data visualization in the same way a sculptor is laying down material. You’re looking at what you think is a forest in southern France which is actually a two-dimensional image that has been made as if it were in three dimensions; every single data point in that image has gone through a process very much like a labor-intensive sculpture. People are dazzled by the images, and they are mesmerizing, but I find that it’s helpful to then use the language of conventional art-making to help show how this work is engaging in complex subject matter and materials, all of which is embedded behind the screen, if you will. People are attracted to screen-based aesthetics because we’re used to being in that space most of the time. The virtual world is just as real as the physical one for almost everyone. We have phones in-hand for many, many hours every day. This both demystifies the output but simultaneously mystifies the process. The process is more hidden, with the final output just “appearing.” People are drawn to it because they feel comfortable looking at things on-screen. Artists are often the earliest adopters of whatever tools civilization comes up with. They’re also able to look at how we interact with those tools and technologies, and make art that reflects what our relationship is to the virtual and to the real, and how those things are coming together. We’re all living in an increasingly hybridized condition, and artists are best able to express and navigate a rich and nuanced understanding of what the future holds.

**JF:** Someone once said to me, the problem with technology isn't technology, it's what people do with technology. I think the same holds for the flipside as well. What humans, and to be more specific, artists do with it, is what makes it powerful. It's a question of whose hands it's in. And it is work. Technology is a static tool. Yes, it's a powerful tool that can vastly expand an artwork's scale and scope, but it's nothing without someone behind the wheel, someone making decisions. And these creative decisions remain as difficult as ever. There is a saying in cycling that even with rigorous training and top-of-the-line components, "it doesn't get easier, you just go faster." I think this is the same for artists working with technology. 

**JD:** New media art is often described as a shift from object-based art to process-based art, and in some ways I think the lack of containability has perpetuated the division between analog and digital arts practices (even as most of us spend so much of our lives in digital contexts). As two people who straddle these worlds, do you see the act of foregrounding new media artists' processes as a sensemaking endeavor for folks who feel they lack the fluency to grok art made using new technologies?

**JF:** I certainly think it's important to communicate the artist's approach as clearly as possible. Technical jargon can be problematic. Digital literacy or fluency is increasingly expected in cultural institutions, but it's a big learning curve. There's the problem of control, not just in terms of power, but in engaging with and keeping these new media works in good working order in the face of rapid technological obsolescence. Just like the sculptures and paintings in its collection, LACMA is responsible for caring for its new media artworks into posterity. Best practices in much of this area are still in their earlier stages of development. Some don't even exist yet. So what do you do when the traditional approaches of working with and caring for objects as well as the workflows that support these practices break down as artists work with newer and newer digital tools? I think this is where process comes in. You have to get into the habit of figuring out best practices as you go, continually refining them. You have to become comfortable with more uncertainty. We have some bright people in various departments who are taking on this challenge, stepping out of their silos and talking with each other, being interdisciplinary. It requires a lot of conversation as well as a humble mindset. It requires participants to think more like a study group of graduate students than a team of professionals. This, however, is a stopgap solution, and sooner rather than later, you have to find a way to sustain this continuous knowledge sharing and co-learning. Give staff the time and space to dedicate themselves more to this process. Give them the resources to do so. Organizations like JPL do this pretty well. They have talented facilitators whose job is to specifically get folks in different areas to talk to one another and tease out new ways of doing things. Will cultural organizations follow suit? Let's hope so.

**AGS:** This also brings up the conversation that’s been going on for a number of years around the dematerialization of the art object, and ephemerality — especially of code-based artwork, which is the ultimate dematerialization. Until you print an image or project something on a containable monitor, you won’t have an object at all. A big part of this discussion is the work’s relationship to the market — how things are valued, how the market interacts with the world of art critique. I do think there’s a really exciting way that the dematerialization of the art object challenges the forces of the market, which doesn’t always reflect the most innovative work, the artists who are reflecting how human existence is changing. It’s (generally) harder to sell something that you can’t hold. It’s harder to sell something that can be infinitely reproduced. How do you put value on that? It’s an interesting question about how we decide what’s valuable, which is of course part of what’s playing out with the rise of NFTs and Web3. What is valuable, who is valuable? The last two years have thrown that latter question into sharp relief; who is valuable, who has rights? So: does the art object itself have value or do the ideas put into the work have value? It goes hand-in-hand with having access. Certainly work that can be shared digitally can be more broadly accessed. How does this intersect with existing control of the art market and its power structures — and by extension, the world of who is collected in museums, who is in important private or public collections? How do we decide what is valuable and what should be shared? So the force of dematerialization that the explosion of digital art, digital artists, and web3 practices has brought about is really provoking these important questions about what is essential, and what do we want the future to look like?

**JD:** What forms have you seen sketches take for these artists when they're not pencil and paper? Any examples to share?

**AGS:** Everything from fiber-optic weaving to light sequencing to coding (which I don’t read myself) to written notes or narratives. Existing photographs that prompt new lines of research.

In the very beginning of some of the projects that we’ve done — if they’re commissions and they’re responding to a particular site or opportunity — are conversations. It’s a process of listening to their ideas when they’re thinking about a certain condition or site, or whatever they’re responding to — in a sense sketches are ideas in their purest form. That process can be much more intimate and interactive when working with artists using new tools and technologies. Very few of these projects emerge from traditional sketches — that’s not something I’d expect to receive. Usually it’s ideas in some form, existing images they find inspiration in, then a whole variety of different materials they might end up working with. 

A good example of a site-specific artwork that’s code-based is by Brian Knep, called [Healing Tiles](http://www.blep.com/works/healing-series/healing-tiles/). It’s an interactive work, with projection on the floor. Forms tear apart as you walk across it, and tear apart differently for each person, and then they heal back together. They heal together like a scar, differently each time. I had seen a project he had done like this at Harvard, he was the first artist-in-residence at Harvard Medical School. With Cincinnati, I thought that sensibility was appropriate for a number of reasons. It’s a public artwork that would have embedded in it a portrait of all the people who walk across that space over time. It’s poetic, and a thoughtful way of connecting everything that happens in this building. Cincinnati, for many black Americans, was the first stop in the Underground Railroad coming from Kentucky to Ohio. No one necessarily sees that impetus for commission, but it’s quite embedded in the idea and the way that it comes to life in these vibrant orange, yellow, and green biomorphic patterns that people play with. It has the depth of history and response to the human condition in a variety of ways that makes it really interesting. Knowing that Brian developed this practice — although the project at Harvard was quite different visually — really made sense to me for that particular space. It’s also projected adjacent to a historic tile floor in this building. Having an artwork that relates to the history of the city and space, as well as future possibilities, seemed like a wonderful way to transform the space and people’s interaction with it. So I just come back to the notion that the material itself, whether you can hold onto it or not, should be embedded and expressive of whatever idea, concept, or issue that the work is responding to, and I often see this play out in unexpected and resonant ways with the new media artists I work with.

**JF:** This is a fun question! I always ask for things in a format that's more pedestrian, but I've received sketches as 3D prints, Sketchup, and Solidworks formats, various audio and video formats. There is an elegance when something is sent simply as a .txt. It's also interesting when the selected format is "wrong" for the sketch, such as when a series of images are presented in a .xls or a one-paragraph descriptive summary without images is just sent as a ppt. My favorite sketch I've received is a cocktail napkin drawing that was photographed and then displayed on a cracked phone screen and rephotographed and sent to me as a .jpg early one morning.
